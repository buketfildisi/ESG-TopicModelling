      "    context=['to stem from low long-term interest rates in mature markets, which have been caused by a variety of reasons. These include the low level of investment that has resulted in an excess supply of global saving, a reduction in inflation risk premia due to greater central bank credibility, reserve accumulation by Asian central banks, and an ongoing shift in institu- tional investor portfolio preferences from equities to bonds. In part reflecting this last factor, equity earnings yields remain relatively high compared to risk-free government bond yields. The search for yield has also been stim- ulated by continued subdued volatility across most financial markets. Directors noted the impact of the search for yield in credit and mortgage markets. Given the compression of spreads in credit markets, investors have increasingly turned to using leverage in various ways to enhance returns, including through a proliferation of struc- tured credit products. They noted that the market quickly', 'noted that shifts in asset allocations by such institutions might unsettle emerging markets with relatively shallow financial markets, or amplify long swings and hinder market price discovery. Directors noted the sustained decline in home bias on the part of institutional investors throughout mature economies over the past 15 years, particularly with regard to equity holdings. Directors agreed that major factors cited in the shift toward more interna- tionalized portfolios included less strict invest- ment restrictions, reduced information costs, and the spread of modern portfolio manage- ment practices. By raising average returns while reducing portfolio volatility, these devel- opments have bolstered financial stability. However, Directors noted that the decline in home bias has also increased cross-border cap- ital flows and has probably led to greater cross-border correlations among asset mar- kets. Accordingly, Directors underscored that Fund surveillance has taken on even', 'frameworks, and of improving basic financial education especially among individual investors. In the context of rising household indebtedness, mainly in the mortgage market, Directors welcomed the warnings that regula- tors in some major countries have given to their lending institutions to tighten credit standards. For the medium term, the risk of growing global imbalances has to be addressed by a cooperative effort by the major coun- tries, with each adopting policies appropriate to its circumstances. Aspects of Global Asset Allocation Directors welcomed the work undertaken by staff on global asset allocation and the increasing role of institutional investors in financial markets. They noted that a better understanding of the investment patterns of pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and, increasingly, hedge funds would help anticipate the potential for abrupt changes in capital flows across borders and asset classes, with direct relevance to financial stability and to'],\n",

U.S. auto sector, and the corporate credit mar- ket functioned surprisingly smoothly in absorbing downgrades in this sector. Directors observed that this likely reflected the relatively isolated nature of the difficulties as the corpo- rate sector remains broadly healthy, with strong balance sheets and low default rates. However, they considered that the corporate credit cycle appears to be peaking as corpora- tions have begun to increase balance sheet leverage in a variety of ways. This has increased the risk of specific corporate credit events causing corrections in credit derivative and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) markets in the period ahead. Directors noted»\n",
