The April \\n2020 Fiscal Monitor describes the fiscal support pack-\\nages that have been announced by governments across \\nthe globe. Large, timely, temporary, and targeted fiscal \\nmeasures are necessary to ensure that a temporary \\nshutdown of activity does not lead to more permanent \\ndamage to the productive capacity of the economy and \\nto society as a whole.\\nCentral banks globally have taken bold and deci-\\nsive actions by easing monetary policy, purchasing a \\nrange of assets, and providing liquidity to the financial \\nsystem in an effort to lean against the tightening in \\nfinancial conditions and maintain the flow of credit \\nto the economy. As policy rates are now near or below \\nzero in many major advanced economies, uncon-\\nventional measures and forward guidance about the \\nexpected policy path are becoming the main tools for \\nthese central banks going forward. Central banks may \\nalso consider further measures to support the economy \\nduring these challenging times.\\nPolicymakers need to maintain a balance between \\nsafeguarding financial stability and supporting eco-\\nnomic activity.\\n• Banks. In the first instance, banks’ existing capital \\nand liquidity buffers should be used to absorb losses \\nand funding pressures. In cases where the impact is \\nsizable or longer lasting and bank capital adequacy \\nis affected, supervisors should take targeted actions, \\nincluding asking banks to submit credible capital \\nrestoration plans. Authorities may also need to step \\nin with fiscal support—either direct subsidies or tax \\nrelief—to help borrowers to repay their loans and \\nfinance their operations, or provide credit guaran-\\ntees to banks. Supervisors should also encourage \\nbanks to negotiate, in a prudent manner, temporary \\nadjustments to loan terms for companies and house-\\nholds struggling to service their debts.\\n• Asset managers. To prudently manage liquidity risks \\nassociated with large outflows, regulators should encourage fund managers to make full use of the \\navailable liquidity tools where it would be in the \\ninterests of unit holders to do so.\\n• Financial markets. Market resilience should be \\npromoted through well-calibrated, clearly defined, \\nand appropriately communicated measures, such as \\ncircuit breakers.\\nMany emerging market economies are already \\nfacing volatile market conditions and should man-\\nage these pressures through exchange rate flexibility, \\nwhere feasible. For countries with adequate reserves, \\nexchange rate intervention can lean against market \\nilliquidity and thus play a role in muting excessive \\nvolatility. However, interventions should not prevent \\nnecessary adjustments in the exchange rate. In the \\nface of an imminent crisis, capital flow management \\nmeasures could be part of a broad policy package, but \\nthey cannot substitute for warranted macroeconomic \\nadjustment. Sovereign debt managers should prepare \\nfor longer-term funding disruptions by putting con-\\ntingency plans in place to deal with limited access to \\nexternal financing.\\nMultilateral cooperation is essential to help reduce \\nthe intensity of the COVID-19 shock and its damage \\nto the global economy and financial system. Coun-\\ntries confronting the twin crises of health and external \\nfunding shocks—for example, those reliant on external \\nfinancing or commodity exporters dealing with the \\nplunge in commodity prices—may additionally need \\nbilateral or multilateral assistance to ensure that health \\nspending is not compromised in their difficult adjust-\\nment process. Official bilateral creditors have been \\ncalled upon by the IMF Managing Director and the \\nWorld Bank President to suspend debt payments \\nfrom countries below the International Development \\nAssociation’s operational threshold that request forbear-\\nance while they battle the pandemic. The IMF , with \\n$1 trillion in available resources, is actively supporting \\nmember countries.',\n",
       " [' International Monetary Fund | April 2018 xiThe global economic outlook has continued \\nto improve, as discussed in the April 2018 World Economic Outlook, with the pace of economic growth picking up and the \\nrecovery becoming more synchronized around the world. While still supportive of economic growth, global financial conditions have tightened somewhat since the October 2017 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR). Such a tightening reflects primarily the bout of equity volatility in early February and a decline in risky asset prices at the end of March follow-ing concerns about a wider escalation of protectionist measures.\\nShort-term risks to financial stability have increased \\nsomewhat relative to the previous GFSR, and medium-term risks continue to be elevated. Financial vulner-abilities, which have accumulated during years of extremely low rates and volatility, could make the road ahead bumpy and could put growth at risk. Indeed, Growth-at-Risk analysis (described in Chapter 3 of the October 2017 GFSR) shows that risks to medium-term economic growth, stemming from easy financial conditions, remain well above historical norms. \\nIn advanced economies, stronger growth momen-\\ntum and the firming of inflation have eased to some extent a key challenge facing central banks: maintain-ing the monetary accommodation required to support the economic recovery while addressing medium-term financial vulnerabilities. But the firming of inflation also brings risks. For example, inflation may pick up faster than currently anticipated, possibly propelled by significant fiscal expansion enacted in the United States. Central banks may respond to higher inflation more aggressively than currently expected, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. This tightening could spill over to risky asset prices, bank dollar funding markets, and both emerging market economies and low-income countries, as discussed below. To minimize these risks, central banks should continue to normalize monetary policy gradually and communicate their decisions clearly to support the economic recovery.Valuations of risky assets are still stretched, with \\nsome late-stage credit cycle dynamics emerging, reminiscent of the precrisis period. This makes markets exposed to a sharp tightening in financial conditions, which could lead to a sudden unwinding of risk premi-ums and a repricing of risky assets. Moreover, liquidity mismatches and the use of financial leverage to boost returns could amplify the impact of asset price moves on the financial system. Although no major disrup-tions were reported during the episode of volatility in early February, market participants should not take too much comfort. Investors and policymakers must remain attuned to the risks associated with higher interest rates and greater volatility.

While still supportive of economic growth, global financial conditions have tightened somewhat since the October 2017 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR). Such a tightening reflects primarily the bout of equity volatility in early February and a decline in risky asset prices at the end of March follow-ing concerns about a wider escalation of protectionist measures.\\nShort-term risks to financial stability have increased \\nsomewhat relative to the previous GFSR, and medium-term risks continue to be elevated. Financial vulner-abilities, which have accumulated during years of extremely low rates and volatility, could make the road ahead bumpy and could put growth at risk. Indeed, Growth-at-Risk analysis (described in Chapter 3 of the October 2017 GFSR) shows that risks to medium-term economic growth, stemming from easy financial conditions, remain well above historical norms. \\nIn advanced economies, stronger growth momen-\\ntum and the firming of inflation have eased to some extent a key challenge facing central banks: maintain-ing the monetary accommodation required to support the economic recovery while addressing medium-term financial vulnerabilities. But the firming of inflation also brings risks. For example, inflation may pick up faster than currently anticipated, possibly propelled by significant fiscal expansion enacted in the United States. Central banks may respond to higher inflation more aggressively than currently expected, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. This tightening could spill over to risky asset prices, bank dollar funding markets, and both emerging market economies and low-income countries, as discussed below. To minimize these risks, central banks should continue to normalize monetary policy gradually and communicate their decisions clearly to support the economic recovery.Valuations of risky assets are still stretched, with \\nsome late-stage credit cycle dynamics emerging, reminiscent of the precrisis period. This makes markets exposed to a sharp tightening in financial conditions, which could lead to a sudden unwinding of risk premi-ums and a repricing of risky assets. Moreover, liquidity mismatches and the use of financial leverage to boost returns could amplify the impact of asset price moves on the financial system. Although no major disrup-tions were reported during the episode of volatility in early February, market participants should not take too much comfort. Investors and policymakers must remain attuned to the risks associated with higher interest rates and greater volatility. Policymakers should address financial vulnerabilities by using more actively the micro- and macroprudential tools at their disposal or by enhancing their toolkits as needed—for example, to address risks in the nonbank financial sector.\\nThe banking sector has become more resilient since \\nthe global financial crisis.

However, crypto assets have been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures, and have been associated with illicit activities. At present, crypto assets do not appear to pose financial stability risks, but they could do so should their use become more widespread without appropriate safeguards.\\nChapter 2 takes a comprehensive look at the evolu-\\ntion of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation, given concerns that the continued search for higher yield may have led banks and investors to extend too much credit to risky borrowers. The chapter docu-ments a pattern in which the firms obtaining more credit are relatively riskier during periods of strong credit expansion, especially when lending standards are loose or financial conditions are easy. An increase in the riskiness of credit allocation signals heightened downside risks to GDP growth and a higher prob-ability of banking stress, in addition to the previously documented signals provided by credit growth. Coun-try authorities can use the measures introduced in this chapter to monitor the buildup of vulnerabilities via risk taking in credit allocation. The chapter discusses policies that can mitigate the increase in credit riski-ness during credit expansions. \\nChapter 3 documents a striking increase in house \\nprice synchronization among 40 countries and 44 major cities in advanced and emerging market econo-mies over the past several decades. The exposure of countries and cities to global financial conditions may help explain that increase. Rising housing valuations since the global financial crisis raise the specter of a simultaneous decline in house prices should financial conditions reverse. The chapter suggests that height-ened synchronicity of house prices can signal a higher probability of adverse scenarios for the real economy, especially when credit is high or rapidly expanding.

However, the size, complexity, and pace of growth in China’s financial system point to elevated financial stability risks. Banking sector assets, at 310 percent of GDP , have risen from 240 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. Furthermore, the grow-ing use of short-term wholesale funding and “shadow credit” to firms has increased vulnerabilities at banks. Authorities face a delicate balance between tightening financial sector policies and slowing economic growth. Reducing the growth of shadow credit even modestly would weigh on the profitability and broader provision of credit by small and medium-sized banks. \\nGlobal Banks’ Health Is Improving\\nThe health of global systemically important banks \\n(GSIBs) continues to improve. Balance sheets are stron-ger because of improved capital and liquidity buffers, amid tighter regulation and heightened market scrutiny. Considerable progress has been made in addressing legacy issues and restructuring challenges. At the same time, while many banks have strengthened their profit-ability by reorienting business models, several continue to grapple with legacy issues and business model chal-lenges. Banks representing about $17 trillion in assets, or about one-third of the GSIB total, may continue to generate unsustainable returns, even in 2019. As problems in even a single GSIB could generate systemic stress, supervisory actions should remain focused on business model risks and sustainable profitability. Life insurers have also been adapting their business strate-gies in the low-yield environment following the global financial crisis. They have done this by reducing legacy exposures, steering the product mix away from high guaranteed returns, and seeking higher yields in invest-ment portfolios. Meanwhile, supervisors need to moni-tor rising exposure to market and credit risks.Policymakers Must Take Proactive Measures\\nPolicymakers must take advantage of the improving \\nglobal outlook and avoid complacency by addressing rising medium-term vulnerabilities. • Policymakers and regulators should fully address crisis legacy problems and require banks and insur-ance companies to strengthen their balance sheets in advanced economies. This includes putting a resolution framework for international banks into operation, focusing on risks from weak bank busi-ness models to ensure sustainable profitability, and finalizing Basel III. Regulatory frameworks for life insurers should be enhanced to increase reporting transparency and incentives to build resilience. A global and coordinated policy response is needed for resilience to cyberattacks (see Box 1.2).\\n• Major central banks should ensure a smooth normalization of monetary policy through well-communicated plans on unwinding their holdings of securities and guidance on prospective changes to policy frameworks. Providing clear paths for policy changes will help anchor market expectations and ward off undue market dislocations or volatility. \\n• Financial authorities should deploy macroprudential measures, and consider extending the boundary of such tools, to curb rising leverage and contain grow-ing risks to stability. For instance, borrower-based measures should be introduced and/or tightened to slow fast-growing overvalued segments, and bank stress tests must assume more stressed asset valua-tions. Capital requirements should be increased for banks that are more exposed to vulnerable borrowers to act as a cushion for already accumulated expo-sures and incentivize banks to grant new loans to less risky sectors.\\n• Regulation of the nonbank financial sector should be strengthened to limit risk migration and excessive capital market financing. T ransition to risk-based supervision should be accelerated, and harmonized regulation of insurance companies—with emphasis on capital—should be introduced. Tighter micro-prudential requirements should be implemented in highly leveraged segments. \\n• Debt overhangs—especially among the largest borrowers as potential originators of shocks—must be addressed. Discouraging further debt buildup through measures that encourage business invest-ment and discourage debt financing will help curb financial risk taking.  x International Monetary Fund | October 2017\\nNear-Term Risks Are Lower\\nThe global financial system continues to strengthen \\nin response to extraordinary policy support, regulatory \\nenhancements, and the cyclical upturn in growth.

This would put these economies in a better position to withstand a reduction in capital inflows as a result of monetary normalization in advanced economies or waning global risk appetite. Similarly, frontier market and low-income-country borrowers should develop the institutional capacity to deal with risks from the issuance of marketable securities, including formulating comprehensive medium-term debt man-agement strategies. This will enable them to take advantage of broader financial market development and access, while containing the associated risks.\\n• In China, the authorities have taken welcome steps to address risks in the financial system, but there is still work to do. Vulnerabilities will be difficult to address without slower credit growth. Recent policies to improve the risk management and transparency of the banking system and reduce the buildup of maturity and liquidity transformation risks in banks’ shadow credit activities are essential and must continue. How-ever, policies should also target balance sheet vulnera-bilities at weak banks. The government’s commitment to reducing corporate leverage is welcome and should remain a priority as part of a broader effort to insulate the economy against slower credit growth. \\n• Although significant progress has been made in developing the postcrisis policy response, progress remains uneven across the various sectors, with several design and implementation issues remain-ing outstanding. Ensuring that the reform mea-sures are completed and implemented is essential to minimize the likelihood of another disruptive crisis. Completing the reform agenda will also allow policymakers to conduct a comprehensive evalua-tion of the impact of the reforms and fine-tune the agreed measures. This will allow them to address any material unintended effects their cumulative implementation might have on the provision of key financial services. This is critical to provide contin-ued assurance that reforms have delivered on their objectives and to stave off emerging pressures to roll back these measures, which would only make the financial system more vulnerable.\\n• Finally, implementation of structural reforms and supportive fiscal policies (as examined in Scenario Box 1 of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook) \\nwould lift global growth and generate positive eco-nomic spillovers, reinforcing financial policy efforts.\\nHousehold Debt and Economic Growth\\nChapter 2 examines the short- and medium-term \\nimplications for economic growth and financial stability of the past decades’ rise in household debt. The chapter documents large differences in household debt-to-GDP ratios across countries but a common increasing trajec-tory that was moderated but not reversed by the global financial crisis. In advanced economies, with notable exceptions, household debt to GDP increased gradu-ally, from 35 percent in 1980 to about 65 percent in 2016, and has kept growing since the global financial crisis, albeit more slowly. In emerging market econo-mies, the same ratio is still much lower, but increased relatively faster over a shorter period, from 5 percent in 1995 to about 20 percent in 2016. Moreover, the rise has been largely unabated in recent years. The chapter finds a trade-off between a short-term boost to growth from higher household debt and a medium-term risk to macroeconomic and financial stability that may result in lower growth, consumption, and employment and a greater risk of banking crises. This trade-off is stronger when household debt is higher and can be attenuated by a combination of good policies, institutions, and regulations. These include appropriate macroprudential and financial sector policies, better financial supervision, less dependence on external financing, flexible exchange rates, and lower income inequality.\\nFinancial Conditions Can Predict Growth\\nThe global financial crisis showed policymakers \\nthat financial conditions offer valuable information about risks to future growth and provide a basis for targeted preemptive action. Chapter 3 develops a new macroeconomic measure of financial stability by link-ing financial conditions to the probability distribution  \\nof future GDP growth and applies it to a set of 21 major advanced and emerging market economies. The chapter shows that changes in financial conditions shift the whole distribution of future GDP growth.

Considerable progress has been made in addressing legacy issues and restructuring challenges. At the same time, while many banks have strengthened their profit-ability by reorienting business models, several continue to grapple with legacy issues and business model chal-lenges. Banks representing about $17 trillion in assets, or about one-third of the GSIB total, may continue to generate unsustainable returns, even in 2019. As problems in even a single GSIB could generate systemic stress, supervisory actions should remain focused on business model risks and sustainable profitability. Life insurers have also been adapting their business strate-gies in the low-yield environment following the global financial crisis. They have done this by reducing legacy exposures, steering the product mix away from high guaranteed returns, and seeking higher yields in invest-ment portfolios. Meanwhile, supervisors need to moni-tor rising exposure to market and credit risks.Policymakers Must Take Proactive Measures\\nPolicymakers must take advantage of the improving \\nglobal outlook and avoid complacency by addressing rising medium-term vulnerabilities. • Policymakers and regulators should fully address crisis legacy problems and require banks and insur-ance companies to strengthen their balance sheets in advanced economies. This includes putting a resolution framework for international banks into operation, focusing on risks from weak bank busi-ness models to ensure sustainable profitability, and finalizing Basel III. Regulatory frameworks for life insurers should be enhanced to increase reporting transparency and incentives to build resilience. A global and coordinated policy response is needed for resilience to cyberattacks (see Box 1.2).\\n• Major central banks should ensure a smooth normalization of monetary policy through well-communicated plans on unwinding their holdings of securities and guidance on prospective changes to policy frameworks. Providing clear paths for policy changes will help anchor market expectations and ward off undue market dislocations or volatility. \\n• Financial authorities should deploy macroprudential measures, and consider extending the boundary of such tools, to curb rising leverage and contain grow-ing risks to stability. For instance, borrower-based measures should be introduced and/or tightened to slow fast-growing overvalued segments, and bank stress tests must assume more stressed asset valua-tions. Capital requirements should be increased for banks that are more exposed to vulnerable borrowers to act as a cushion for already accumulated expo-sures and incentivize banks to grant new loans to less risky sectors.\\n• Regulation of the nonbank financial sector should be strengthened to limit risk migration and excessive capital market financing. T ransition to risk-based supervision should be accelerated, and harmonized regulation of insurance companies—with emphasis on capital—should be introduced. Tighter micro-prudential requirements should be implemented in highly leveraged segments. \\n• Debt overhangs—especially among the largest borrowers as potential originators of shocks—must be addressed. Discouraging further debt buildup through measures that encourage business invest-ment and discourage debt financing will help curb financial risk taking. xii International Monetary Fund | October 2017\\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: IS GROWTH AT RISK?• Emerging market economies should continue to \\ntake advantage of supportive external conditions to enhance their resilience, including by continu-ing to strengthen external positions where needed, and reduce corporate leverage where it is high. This would put these economies in a better position to withstand a reduction in capital inflows as a result of monetary normalization in advanced economies or waning global risk appetite. Similarly, frontier market and low-income-country borrowers should develop the institutional capacity to deal with risks from the issuance of marketable securities, including formulating comprehensive medium-term debt man-agement strategies. This will enable them to take advantage of broader financial market development and access, while containing the associated risks.\\n• In China, the authorities have taken welcome steps to address risks in the financial system, but there is still work to do. Vulnerabilities will be difficult to address without slower credit growth. Recent policies to improve the risk management and transparency of the banking system and reduce the buildup of maturity and liquidity transformation risks in banks’ shadow credit activities are essential and must continue. How-ever, policies should also target balance sheet vulnera-bilities at weak banks. The government’s commitment to reducing corporate leverage is welcome and should remain a priority as part of a broader effort to insulate the economy against slower credit growth. \\n• Although significant progress has been made in developing the postcrisis policy response, progress remains uneven across the various sectors, with several design and implementation issues remain-ing outstanding. Ensuring that the reform mea-sures are completed and implemented is essential to minimize the likelihood of another disruptive crisis. Completing the reform agenda will also allow policymakers to conduct a comprehensive evalua-tion of the impact of the reforms and fine-tune the agreed measures. This will allow them to address any material unintended effects their cumulative implementation might have on the provision of key financial services. This is critical to provide contin-ued assurance that reforms have delivered on their objectives and to stave off emerging pressures to roll back these measures, which would only make the financial system more vulnerable.\\n• Finally, implementation of structural reforms and supportive fiscal policies (as examined in Scenario Box 1 of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook) \\nwould lift global growth and generate positive eco-nomic spillovers, reinforcing financial policy efforts.\\nHousehold Debt and Economic Growth\\nChapter 2 examines the short- and medium-term \\nimplications for economic growth and financial stability of the past decades’ rise in household debt. The chapter documents large differences in household debt-to-GDP ratios across countries but a common increasing trajec-tory that was moderated but not reversed by the global financial crisis. In advanced economies, with notable exceptions, household debt to GDP increased gradu-ally, from 35 percent in 1980 to about 65 percent in 2016, and has kept growing since the global financial crisis, albeit more slowly. In emerging market econo-mies, the same ratio is still much lower, but increased relatively faster over a shorter period, from 5 percent in 1995 to about 20 percent in 2016. Moreover, the rise has been largely unabated in recent years. The chapter finds a trade-off between a short-term boost to growth from higher household debt and a medium-term risk to macroeconomic and financial stability that may result in lower growth, consumption, and employment and a greater risk of banking crises. This trade-off is stronger when household debt is higher and can be attenuated by a combination of good policies, institutions, and regulations. These include appropriate macroprudential and financial sector policies, better financial supervision, less dependence on external financing, flexible exchange rates, and lower income inequality.\\nFinancial Conditions Can Predict Growth\\nThe global financial crisis showed policymakers \\nthat financial conditions offer valuable information about risks to future growth and provide a basis for targeted preemptive action. Chapter 3 develops a new macroeconomic measure of financial stability by link-ing financial conditions to the probability distribution  \\nof future GDP growth and applies it to a set of 21 major advanced and emerging market economies. The chapter shows that changes in financial conditions shift the whole distribution of future GDP growth. Wider risk spreads, rising asset price volatility, and waning global risk appetite are significant predictors of increased downside risks to growth in the near term, and higher leverage and credit growth provide exeCutIve su MM ary\\n International Monetary Fund | October 2017 xiiirelevant signals of such risks in the medium term. \\nToday’s prevailing low funding costs and financial market volatility support a sanguine view of risks to the global economy in the near term. But increasing leverage signals potential risks down the road, and a scenario of a rapid decompression in spreads and volatility could significantly worsen the risk outlook for global growth. A retrospective real-time analysis of the global financial crisis shows that forecasting models augmented with financial conditions would have assigned a considerably higher likelihood to the economic contraction that followed than those based on recent growth alone. This confirms that the analytical approach developed in the chapter can be a significant addition to policymakers’ macro-financial \\nsurveillance toolkit. '],\n",

In China, the authorities \\nhad to intervene in three regional banks. Among non-\\nUS banks, US dollar funding fragilities—which were \\na cause of significant stress during the global financial \\ncrisis—remain a source of vulnerability in many econo-\\nmies, as discussed in Chapter 5.

In economies where overall \\ncorporate sector debt is deemed to be systemically \\nhigh, in addition to sector-specific prudential tools \\nfor banks, policymakers may consider developing \\nprudential tools for highly leveraged firms. Reducing \\nthe bias in tax systems that favors debt over equity \\nfinancing would also help reduce incentives for \\nexcessive borrowing.\\n• Increasing holdings of riskier and more illiquid \\nsecurities by institutional investors: The oversight of \\nnonbank financial entities should be strengthened. \\nVulnerabilities among institutional investors can \\nbe addressed through appropriate incentives (for \\nexample, to reduce the offering of guaranteed return \\nproducts), minimum solvency and liquidity stan-\\ndards, and enhanced disclosure.\\n• Increased reliance on external borrowing by emerging \\nand frontier market economies: Indebted emerging \\nmarket and frontier economies should mitigate debt \\nsustainability risks through prudent debt man-\\nagement practices and strong debt management \\nframeworks.\\nGlobal policy coordination remains critical.

As these investors become a larger \\nshare of portfolio flows, external shocks may propa-\\ngate to medium-size emerging and frontier market \\neconomies faster than in the past. \\n• House prices at risk (HaR): The recent rapid increase \\nin house prices in many countries has raised con-\\ncerns about the possibility of a price correction. \\nA new house prices-at-risk framework, presented \\nin Chapter 2 of this report, is used to quantify \\ndownside risks to house price growth. Lower house \\nprice momentum, overvaluation, excessive credit \\ngrowth, and tighter financial conditions help predict \\ndownside risks to house prices up to three years \\nahead. In turn, the measure of house prices at risk \\nhelps forecast downside risks to GDP growth and \\npredict financial crises. The most recent data point \\nto increased downside risks to house prices over the \\nnext one to three years in some countries.\\nLooking ahead, there is a risk that positive investor \\nsentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp \\ntightening of financial conditions. This will have a larger \\neffect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater \\nfinancial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond \\nto shocks. Possible triggers include the following: \\n• A sharper-than-expected growth slowdown could lead \\nto tighter financial conditions as risk asset prices fall, \\nreflecting a weaker outlook for corporate earnings, \\neven as policies turn more accommodative. \\n• An unexpected shift to a less dovish outlook for mon-\\netary policy in advanced economies could trigger a \\nrepricing in markets, especially if investors realize \\nthat they have taken too benign a view on the mon-\\netary policy stance.  \\n• Political and policy risks, such as an escalation of \\ntrade tensions or a no-deal Brexit, could affect mar-\\nket sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. \\nAmid rising downside risks to global growth, policy-\\nmakers should aim to avoid a sharper economic slow-\\ndown, while keeping financial vulnerabilities in check: • Policymakers should clearly communicate any \\nreassessment of the monetary policy stance that \\nreflects either changes in the economic outlook or \\nrisks surrounding the outlook. This will help avoid \\nunnecessary swings in financial markets or unduly \\ncompressed market volatility. \\n• In countries with high or rising financial vulner-\\nabilities, policymakers should proactively deploy \\nprudential tools or expand their macroprudential \\ntoolkits where needed. These countries would benefit \\nfrom activating or tightening broad-based macro-\\nprudential measures, such as countercyclical capital \\nbuffers, to increase the financial system’s resilience. \\nEfforts should also focus on developing prudential \\ntools to address rising corporate debt from nonbank \\nfinancial intermediaries and maturity and liquid-\\nity mismatches in the nonbank sector. Regulators \\nshould also ensure that more comprehensive stress \\ntests (that include macro-financial feedback effects) \\nare conducted for banks and nonbank lenders. \\n• Measures to repair public and private balance sheets \\nshould be stepped up. A gradual fiscal adjustment \\nis needed to reduce elevated risks, based on policies \\nthat will support medium-term growth. Efforts to \\ntackle nonperforming loans on euro area bank bal-\\nance sheets should continue. Given concerns about \\nthe sovereign–financial sector nexus, consideration \\ncould be given to mitigating concentration risk in \\nbanks’ sovereign exposures.\\n• Emerging market economies should ensure resilience \\nagainst foreign portfolio outflows by reducing excessive \\nexternal liabilities, cutting reliance on short-term \\ndebt, and maintaining adequate fiscal and foreign \\nexchange reserve buffers. Given the rising impor-\\ntance of benchmark-driven portfolio flows, a close \\ndialogue is needed between index providers, the \\ninvestment community, and regulators. Building on \\nthe progress achieved so far, the Chinese authori-\\nties should continue financial sector de-risking and \\ndeleveraging policies and put greater emphasis on \\naddressing bank vulnerabilities.

In emerging market economies, progress on lowering \\ninflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early \\nrate hikes becoming apparent. However, there are discrepancies \\nacross regions. Widening divergence of inflation and economic \\noutlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of \\nthe global monetary policy. \\nYet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, \\nwhereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is \\navoided, has fueled asset valuation since the April 2023 Global \\nFinancial Stability Report. Despite the declines in equity prices \\nsince September, driven by rising long-term real rates, finan-\\ncial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net \\n(Figure ES.1). Taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, \\nstock prices in Europe and the United States have climbed \\nabout 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit \\nspreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of \\nthis rate hike cycle. In Japan, equities have outperformed other \\nadvanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-\\netary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. \\nEmerging markets such as Chile, Hungary, India, Mexico, and \\nPoland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-\\ntent with the appreciation of most major emerging market \\ncurrencies in the first half of the year. Upside surprises to the \\ninflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, \\nresulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. \\nWhile acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, \\na weak tail of banks remains in some countries. In addition, \\ncracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could \\nturn into worrisome fault lines. In the event of an abrupt \\ntightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could \\nbe triggered and again test the resilience of the global finan-\\ncial system.

In addition, a major \\nasset manager, which suspended payments and redemptions on \\nits wealth management and trust products, has raised concerns \\nabout further financial stress if the public were to lose confi-\\ndence in investment products.\\nInvestors continue to differentiate between emerging market \\neconomies with stronger fundamentals and policy buffers and \\nthose considered less resilient and more vulnerable to shocks. \\nMost emerging market sovereign credit spreads have remained \\nnarrow despite the continued tightening of monetary policy \\nand higher yields (Figure ES.6). However, the gap between the \\ninvestment-grade and high-yield segments of emerging market \\nsovereign debt markets remains wide. Repeated credit down-\\ngrades since the pandemic have pushed the average frontier \\nsovereign rating lower, driving implied spreads and financing \\ncosts higher across many emerging market economies. \\nAs the primary lenders in the global economy, banks are \\nexpected to deal with greater credit costs as higher interest \\nrates reduce borrowers’ ability to repay loans. In aggregate, the \\nbanking system appears to have prudently added provisions for \\nmore defaults, and loan-loss reserves seem adequate to cover \\nnonperforming loans in many countries. Higher rates should \\nalso support net interest margins on new bank loans. That said, \\nhistory has shown that credit exposures can deteriorate rapidly, \\nand loan demand can plummet when an economy enters a \\nrecession, affecting bank profitability. Chapter 2 presents the \\nIMF’s assessment of the quantum of banks vulnerable to higher \\ninflation and interest rates using two new approaches. The \\nassessment conducts an enhanced version of the IMF’s global \\nstress test, complemented by a new forward-looking monitoring \\nframework that incorporates analyst forecasts of key risk indica-\\ntors—bank balance sheet, valuation, and profitability metrics. \\nBoth approaches indicate the presence of a notably weak tail of \\nbanks. The global stress test shows a wide set of banks will suffer \\ncapital losses under an adverse stagflationary scenario, including \\nseveral systemically important institutions in China, Europe, \\nand the United States (Figure ES.7). This finding is consistent \\nwith the key risk indicators which project that some Chinese \\nand US banks are likely to remain under pressure given lower \\nexpected earnings and the depressed price-to-book ratios of \\nChinese banks.\\nAn environment of high interest rates is likely to benefit some \\nnonbank financial intermediaries while challenging the resilience \\nof others. For institutions with longer-term financial obliga-\\ntions, such as insurers and pension funds, elevated interest rates \\nhave reduced the present value of their liabilities and improved \\nfunded ratios.

Central banks must \\nremain determined in their fight against inflation until \\nthere is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably \\ntoward targets, although the stance of monetary policy \\nshould reflect a country-specific pace of economic \\nrecovery and disinflationary processes. Communication \\nremains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. \\nProgress on inflation in a number of emerging market \\neconomies has been notable, but central banks should \\nbe cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. \\nCountries should integrate their policies, including, \\nwhere applicable, within the Integrated Policy Frame-\\nwork, the IMF’s macrofinancial framework for countries \\nto manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows \\namid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the \\nforeign exchange environment. Optimal policy combi-\\nnations depend on the nature of the shock and country-\\nspecific characteristics. Any response measures should be \\npart of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic \\nimbalances and allows for needed adjustments. \\nSovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, \\nfrontier markets, and low-income countries should \\nstrengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their \\nhigh debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue \\nwith creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support \\nfrom the international community. If applicable, the \\nGroup of T wenty Common Framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, \\nincluding in preemptive restructurings. Bilateral and \\nprivate sector creditors should find ways to coordinate \\npreemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly \\nhard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. \\nWhere feasible, refinancing or liability management \\noperations should be executed to rebuild buffers. \\nIn China, robust policies to restore confidence in \\nthe real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of \\nnegative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, \\nand local governments. Priority should be given to \\nfacilitating the completion of housing projects, which \\ncould stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and \\nthe timely resolution and restructuring of troubled \\nproperty developers. Easing monetary policy further \\nand reorienting fiscal support toward households are \\nnecessary to support economic growth. A comprehen-\\nsive strategy is needed to address the LGFV debt issue \\nto restore LGFVs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve \\nsustainable levels of local government debt. Although \\nauthorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate \\nsystemic risks emanating from the asset management \\nsector, further progress is needed to address risky \\nexposures to real estate and LGFVs and liquidity mis-\\nmatches between their assets and liabilities. For banks, \\nmaintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing \\nout forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss \\nrecognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak \\nbanks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. \\nThe sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial \\nsystem and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions \\nhighlights the urgent need to implement international \\nstandards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, \\nassess whether specific features of these standards \\nperformed as intended during the recent turmoil, and \\nenhance supervision where necessary. Adequate mini-\\nmum capital and liquidity requirements across large \\nand small institutions alike are essential to contain \\nfinancial stability risks. Authorities should be more \\nprepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in \\nbanks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to \\naccess central bank facilities, and strengthening where \\nneeded their bank resolution regimes and preparedness \\nto deploy them. \\nNational authorities should deploy stringent stress \\ntests to estimate the potential effects of diminished \\nborrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline \\nin residential real estate prices on household balance \\nsheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions. Con-\\ntinued vigilance is warranted to monitor  vulnerabilities   International Monetary Fund | October 2023 xi\\nSoft Landing or Abrupt Awakening?\\nWith core inflation still high and declining only slowly in \\nmany advanced economies, central banks may need to keep \\nmonetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in \\nmarkets. In emerging market economies, progress on lowering \\ninflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early \\nrate hikes becoming apparent. However, there are discrepancies \\nacross regions. Widening divergence of inflation and economic \\noutlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of \\nthe global monetary policy. \\nYet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, \\nwhereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is \\navoided, has fueled asset valuation since the April 2023 Global \\nFinancial Stability Report. Despite the declines in equity prices \\nsince September, driven by rising long-term real rates, finan-\\ncial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net \\n(Figure ES.1). Taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, \\nstock prices in Europe and the United States have climbed \\nabout 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit \\nspreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of \\nthis rate hike cycle. In Japan, equities have outperformed other \\nadvanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-\\netary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. \\nEmerging markets such as Chile, Hungary, India, Mexico, and \\nPoland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-\\ntent with the appreciation of most major emerging market \\ncurrencies in the first half of the year. Upside surprises to the \\ninflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, \\nresulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. \\nWhile acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, \\na weak tail of banks remains in some countries. In addition, \\ncracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could \\nturn into worrisome fault lines. In the event of an abrupt \\ntightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could \\nbe triggered and again test the resilience of the global finan-\\ncial system. Most notably, the global credit cycle has started \\nto turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and \\ncredit growth slows. The IMF’s growth-at-risk measure summa-\\nrizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are \\nskewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in April 2023 \\n(Figure ES.2). In a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing \\ndoes not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and \\nfinancial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the \\ngrowth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more \\nfirmly skewed to the downside.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nUnited States\\nEuro area\\nOther advanced economies\\nChina\\nEmerging markets excluding ChinaApr.\\n2023\\nGFSRFigure ES.1.

       " ['xii International Monetary Fund | April 2023\\nA Financial System Tested by Higher Inflation and \\nInterest Rates\\nFinancial stability risks have risen significantly as the resil-\\nience of the global financial system has faced a number of severe \\ntests since the October 2022 Global Financial Stability Report.

Amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the US banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (Figure ES.1).

But market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system.\\nThe fundamental question confronting market participants and \\npolicymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan -\\ncial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. While there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).

In Europe, the impact was greatest on banks that trade at significant discounts to their book values, in which there are long-term concerns regarding profitability and their ability to raise capital. \\nEmerging market banks appear to have avoided significant \\nlosses in their securities portfolios so far, while deposit funding has been stable. IMF staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in Europe, Japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (Figure ES.4). That said, many \\n countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and \\nemerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. In addition, emerging \\nmarket banks  generally play a larger role in the financial system \\nthan in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. \\nThese events have been a reminder that funding can disappear \\nrapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. Shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. These concerns are particularly pertinent for US regional banks. With the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of US banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real GDP by 44 basis points, all else being equal.\\nThe Challenges Ahead\\nThe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating \\nthe task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. Before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. Since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (Figure ES.5). They now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. Inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.\\nAfter having significantly increased their securities holdings \\nduring the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. This normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. In the United States, for example, net issuance of the US T reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while quantitative United States\\nEurope\\nJapan\\nEmerging marketsFigure ES.4.

For example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (Figure ES.7).\\nLarge emerging markets have so far managed relatively \\nsmoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. However, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. \\nSovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen \\naround the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. There are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (Figure ES.8).\\nIn frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 \\nand may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (Figure ES.9). Low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. They continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. \\nLooking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-\\nlated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. However, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. The steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. Average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. Economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. Valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (Figure ES.10). \\nConcerns have been growing about conditions in the com-\\nmercial real estate (CRE) market, which has been under pressure from a worsening of fundamentals and tighter funding costs.

IMF staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in Europe, Japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (Figure ES.4). That said, many \\n countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and \\nemerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. In addition, emerging \\nmarket banks  generally play a larger role in the financial system \\nthan in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. \\nThese events have been a reminder that funding can disappear \\nrapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. Shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. These concerns are particularly pertinent for US regional banks. With the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of US banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real GDP by 44 basis points, all else being equal.\\nThe Challenges Ahead\\nThe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating \\nthe task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. Before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. Since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (Figure ES.5). They now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. Inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.\\nAfter having significantly increased their securities holdings \\nduring the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. This normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. In the United States, for example, net issuance of the US T reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while quantitative United States\\nEurope\\nJapan\\nEmerging marketsFigure ES.4.

For example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (Figure ES.7).\\nLarge emerging markets have so far managed relatively \\nsmoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. However, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. \\nSovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen \\naround the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. There are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (Figure ES.8).\\nIn frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 \\nand may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (Figure ES.9). Low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. They continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. \\nLooking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-\\nlated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. However, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. The steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. Average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. Economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. Valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (Figure ES.10). \\nConcerns have been growing about conditions in the com-\\nmercial real estate (CRE) market, which has been under pressure from a worsening of fundamentals and tighter funding costs.

In addition, NBFIs play an important role in the real estate invest-ment trusts (REITs) sector and commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, so there are broader implications stemming from stress in the CRE market, both for financial stability and for economic growth. Global transaction activity has decreased by 17 percent from the previous year, and REITs have seen price corrections up to 20 percent. Losses have been particularly elevated in the office sector, as demand and occupancy rates are more anemic in the post-pandemic environment. \\nFor firms, default rates have remained low, as the sector’s \\nsubstantial cash buffers built during the pandemic have pro-vided financial cushioning (Figure ES.11). However, declining corporate earnings and tighter funding conditions have started to erode these buffers and could lead to repayment difficulties down the road and expose firms to defaults. Small firms and emerging market corporates would likely be more adversely affected because they lack alternative sources of financing to bank lending, the standards of which have already started \\nto tighten.\\nChina’s housing market remains sluggish despite its reopen-\\ning. Although financing conditions have improved for some property developers, home buyers continue to avoid purchas-ing from weaker private developers, underscoring the limited progress in restoring confidence in the broader housing market. Concerns about debt sustainability of local government financial vehicles (LGFVs)—which are heavily involved in the property market—intensified in 2022; with total LGFV debt estimated at about 50 percent of China’s GDP , a broadening of LGFV debt distress could impose significant losses on some banks, particu-larly in low-income regions with higher local government debt and large stocks of unfinished housing (Figure ES.12). \\nChapter 2 shows that NBFIs are increasingly interconnected \\nwith banks globally (Figure ES.13). Case studies show that non-bank financial intermediary stress tends to emerge with elevated leverage, poor liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness, and that it can spill across jurisdictions, including to emerging market and developing economies. These vulnerabilities may be heightened in the current high-inflation environment, as the provision of liquidity by central banks for financial stability purposes becomes more challenging, including from a commu-nications standpoint, and it could undermine the fight against inflation.\\nChapter 3 documents how rising geopolitical tensions among \\nmajor economies could raise financial stability risks by increas-ing global economic and financial fragmentation and adversely affect the cross-border allocation of capital (Figure ES.14).

In \\nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis, amid extremely low interest rates, compressed volatility, and ample liquidity, market participants increased their exposures to liquidity, duration, and credit risk, often employing financial leverage to boost returns—vulnerabilities repeatedly flagged in previous issues of the Global Financial Stability Report. \\nThe sudden failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature \\nBank in the United States, and the loss of market confidence in Credit Suisse, a global systemically important bank (GSIB) in Europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities. Amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the US banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (Figure ES.1). It also led to a significant repricing of monetary policy rate expec-tations, with magnitude and scale comparable to that of Black Monday in 1987 (Figure ES.2). \\nThe forceful response by policymakers to stem systemic risks \\nreduced market anxiety. In the United States, bank regulators took steps to guarantee uninsured deposits at the two failed institutions and to provide liquidity through a new Bank Term Funding Program to prevent further bank runs. In Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank provided emergency liquidity support to Credit Suisse, which was then taken over by UBS in a state-supported acquisition. But market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system.\\nThe fundamental question confronting market participants and \\npolicymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan -\\ncial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. While there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).

In \\nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis, amid extremely low interest rates, compressed volatility, and ample liquidity, market participants increased their exposures to liquidity, duration, and credit risk, often employing financial leverage to boost returns—vulnerabilities repeatedly flagged in previous issues of the Global Financial Stability Report. \\nThe sudden failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature \\nBank in the United States, and the loss of market confidence in Credit Suisse, a global systemically important bank (GSIB) in Europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities. Amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the US banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (Figure ES.1). It also led to a significant repricing of monetary policy rate expec-tations, with magnitude and scale comparable to that of Black Monday in 1987 (Figure ES.2). \\nThe forceful response by policymakers to stem systemic risks \\nreduced market anxiety. In the United States, bank regulators took steps to guarantee uninsured deposits at the two failed institutions and to provide liquidity through a new Bank Term Funding Program to prevent further bank runs. In Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank provided emergency liquidity support to Credit Suisse, which was then taken over by UBS in a state-supported acquisition. But market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system.\\nThe fundamental question confronting market participants and \\npolicymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan -\\ncial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. While there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).

In Europe, the impact was greatest on banks that trade at significant discounts to their book values, in which there are long-term concerns regarding profitability and their ability to raise capital. \\nEmerging market banks appear to have avoided significant \\nlosses in their securities portfolios so far, while deposit funding has been stable. IMF staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in Europe, Japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (Figure ES.4). That said, many \\n countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and \\nemerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. In addition, emerging \\nmarket banks  generally play a larger role in the financial system \\nthan in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. \\nThese events have been a reminder that funding can disappear \\nrapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. Shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. These concerns are particularly pertinent for US regional banks. With the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of US banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real GDP by 44 basis points, all else being equal.\\nThe Challenges Ahead\\nThe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating \\nthe task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. Before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. Since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (Figure ES.5). They now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. Inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.\\nAfter having significantly increased their securities holdings \\nduring the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. This normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. In the United States, for example, net issuance of the US T reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while quantitative United States\\nEurope\\nJapan\\nEmerging marketsFigure ES.4.

For example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (Figure ES.7).\\nLarge emerging markets have so far managed relatively \\nsmoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. However, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. \\nSovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen \\naround the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. There are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (Figure ES.8).\\nIn frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 \\nand may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (Figure ES.9). Low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. They continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. \\nLooking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-\\nlated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. However, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. The steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. Average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. Economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. Valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (Figure ES.10). \\nConcerns have been growing about conditions in the com-\\nmercial real estate (CRE) market, which has been under pressure from a worsening of fundamentals and tighter funding costs.

In addition, NBFIs play an important role in the real estate invest-ment trusts (REITs) sector and commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, so there are broader implications stemming from stress in the CRE market, both for financial stability and for economic growth. Global transaction activity has decreased by 17 percent from the previous year, and REITs have seen price corrections up to 20 percent. Losses have been particularly elevated in the office sector, as demand and occupancy rates are more anemic in the post-pandemic environment. \\nFor firms, default rates have remained low, as the sector’s \\nsubstantial cash buffers built during the pandemic have pro-vided financial cushioning (Figure ES.11). However, declining corporate earnings and tighter funding conditions have started to erode these buffers and could lead to repayment difficulties down the road and expose firms to defaults. Small firms and emerging market corporates would likely be more adversely affected because they lack alternative sources of financing to bank lending, the standards of which have already started \\nto tighten.\\nChina’s housing market remains sluggish despite its reopen-\\ning. Although financing conditions have improved for some property developers, home buyers continue to avoid purchas-ing from weaker private developers, underscoring the limited progress in restoring confidence in the broader housing market. Concerns about debt sustainability of local government financial vehicles (LGFVs)—which are heavily involved in the property market—intensified in 2022; with total LGFV debt estimated at about 50 percent of China’s GDP , a broadening of LGFV debt distress could impose significant losses on some banks, particu-larly in low-income regions with higher local government debt and large stocks of unfinished housing (Figure ES.12). \\nChapter 2 shows that NBFIs are increasingly interconnected \\nwith banks globally (Figure ES.13). Case studies show that non-bank financial intermediary stress tends to emerge with elevated leverage, poor liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness, and that it can spill across jurisdictions, including to emerging market and developing economies. These vulnerabilities may be heightened in the current high-inflation environment, as the provision of liquidity by central banks for financial stability purposes becomes more challenging, including from a commu-nications standpoint, and it could undermine the fight against inflation.\\nChapter 3 documents how rising geopolitical tensions among \\nmajor economies could raise financial stability risks by increas-ing global economic and financial fragmentation and adversely affect the cross-border allocation of capital (Figure ES.14).

Liquidity \\nshould be provided to counterparties that are compelled by supervision and regulation to internalize liquidity risk (the “stick”) so that central banks may need to intervene only to address systemic liquidity risks (the “carrot”). A significant part of the risk should remain in the marketplace (“partial insurance”) to minimize moral hazard, and interventions should have a well-defined end date allowing market forces to reassert themselves once acute strains subside.\\nSome of the recent responses by policymakers \\nsuggest that further work is needed on the resolution reform agenda to increase the likelihood that systemic banks can be resolved without putting public funds at risk. While it is a positive development that sharehold-ers and holders of other capital instruments incurred losses, allocating more losses across the creditor hierarchy before public funds are put at risk is proving harder to deliver. The international community will need to take stock of these experiences and draw policy conclusions on the effectiveness of resolution reforms after the global financial crisis. \\nAccording to the IMF’s Integrated Policy Frame-\\nwork, foreign exchange interventions may be appropri-ate in the case of illiquid foreign exchange markets, balance sheet mismatches, and weakly anchored infla-tion expectation, so long as reserves are sufficient and intervention does not impair the credibility of mac-roeconomic policies or substitute for their necessary adjustment. In case of imminent crises, capital outflow \\nmeasures may be an option to lessen outflow pres-sures, although they should be part of a comprehensive policy package that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and be lifted once crisis conditions abate.Sovereign borrowers in developing economies and \\nfrontier markets should enhance efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, includ-ing through early contact with their creditors, multi-lateral cooperation, and support from the international community. Enacting credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans could help contain borrowing costs and alleviate debt sustainability concerns. For countries near debt distress, bilateral and private sector creditors should coordinate on preemptive restructuring, using the G20 Common Framework where applicable.\\nProviding nonbank financial institutions with direct \\naccess to central bank liquidity could prove necessary in times of stress, but implementing appropriate guard-rails is paramount. As a first line of defense, robust surveillance, regulation, and supervision of nonbank financial institutions are vital. If financial stability is threatened, situationally appropriate central bank liquidity support for nonbank financial institutions can be considered—discretionary marketwide operations, standing lending facilities, or lender of last resort—but such support needs to be carefully designed to avoid moral hazard. \\nPolicymakers should devote resources to assess-\\ning, managing, and mitigating financial stability risks caused by geopolitical tensions rising. Financial institu-tions may need to hold adequate capital and liquidity \\nbuffers to mitigate such geopolitical risks. Policy  makers \\nshould also ensure that the global financial safety net is adequate. Given the significant risks to global macro-financial stability, multilateral efforts should be strengthened to diplomatically resolve geopo-litical tensions and prevent economic and financial fragmentation.\\n30082_00_FM.indd   17 09/04/2023   11:29 PM'],\n",
       " [' International Monetary Fund | October 2022 xi\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThe world economy is experiencing stubbornly high \\ninflation, a challenge it has not faced for decades. \\nFollowing the global financial crisis, with inflationary \\npressures muted, interest rates were extremely low for \\nyears and investors became accustomed to low volatility. The \\nresulting easing of financial conditions supported economic \\ngrowth, but it also contributed to a buildup of financial vulner-\\nabilities. Now, with inflation at multidecade highs, monetary \\nauthorities in advanced economies are accelerating the pace \\nof policy normalization. Policymakers in emerging markets \\nhave continued to tighten policy against a backdrop of rising \\ninflation and currency pressures, albeit with notable differences \\nacross regions. Global financial conditions have tightened nota-\\nbly this year, leading to capital outflows from many emerging \\nand frontier market economies with weaker macroeconomic \\nfundamentals. Amid heightened economic and geopoliti-\\ncal uncertainties, investors have aggressively pulled back from \\nrisk-taking in September.

But regional differences \\nremain stark, with some countries hiking policy rates earlier and \\nmore aggressively in response to inflationary pressures. Condi-\\ntions in local currency bond markets have worsened materi-\\nally, reflecting concerns about the macroeconomic outlook and \\nrising debt levels. Sovereign bond term premiums have increased \\nsharply, especially for central and eastern Europe.\\nEmerging markets face a multitude of risks stemming from \\nhigh external borrowing costs, stubbornly high inflation, volatile \\ncommodity markets, heightened uncertainty about the global eco-\\nnomic outlook, and pressures from policy tightening in advanced \\neconomies. Pressures are particularly acute in frontier markets, \\nwhere challenges are driven by a combination of tightening finan-\\ncial conditions, deteriorating fundamentals, and high exposure to \\ncommodity price volatility. Interest expenses on government debt \\nhave continued to rise, increasing immediate liquidity pressures. \\nIn an environment of poor fundamentals and lack of investor risk \\nappetite, defaults may follow. However, investors have continued \\nto differentiate across emerging market economies so far, and \\nmany of the largest emerging markets seem to be more resilient to \\nexternal vulnerabilities. Nonresident portfolio flows remain weak \\ndespite some signs of stabilization after sizable outflows in the first \\nhalf of the year (Figure 6). Issuance of sovereign hard currency \\nbonds has deteriorated sharply. Without an improvement in mar-\\nket access, many frontier market issuers will have to seek alterna-\\ntive funding sources and/or debt reprofiling and restructurings.\\nThe challenging macroeconomic environment is also pres-\\nsuring the global corporate sector. Credit spreads have widened \\nsubstantially across sectors since April. Large firms have reported \\na contraction in profit margins due to higher costs, while down-\\nward revisions to global earnings growth forecasts appear to be \\ngaining momentum on concerns about a possible recession. At \\nsmall firms, bankruptcies have already started to increase in major \\nadvanced economies because these firms are more affected by ris-\\ning borrowing costs and declining fiscal support. Companies that \\nrely on leveraged finance markets are facing tighter lending terms \\nand standards against a challenging growth backdrop. The credit \\nquality of these assets may be tested during an economic down-\\nturn, with potential spillovers to the broader macroeconomy.\\nAs central banks aggressively tighten monetary policy, soaring \\nborrowing costs and tighter lending standards, coupled with \\nstretched valuations after years of rising prices, could adversely \\naffect housing markets.

International Monetary Fund | October 2022 xi\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThe world economy is experiencing stubbornly high \\ninflation, a challenge it has not faced for decades. \\nFollowing the global financial crisis, with inflationary \\npressures muted, interest rates were extremely low for \\nyears and investors became accustomed to low volatility. The \\nresulting easing of financial conditions supported economic \\ngrowth, but it also contributed to a buildup of financial vulner-\\nabilities. Now, with inflation at multidecade highs, monetary \\nauthorities in advanced economies are accelerating the pace \\nof policy normalization. Policymakers in emerging markets \\nhave continued to tighten policy against a backdrop of rising \\ninflation and currency pressures, albeit with notable differences \\nacross regions. Global financial conditions have tightened nota-\\nbly this year, leading to capital outflows from many emerging \\nand frontier market economies with weaker macroeconomic \\nfundamentals. Amid heightened economic and geopoliti-\\ncal uncertainties, investors have aggressively pulled back from \\nrisk-taking in September. With conditions worsening in recent \\nweeks, key gauges of systemic risk, such as higher dollar fund-\\ning costs and counterparty credit spreads, have risen. There is a \\nrisk of a disorderly tightening of financial conditions that may \\nbe amplified by vulnerabilities built over the years. The report \\nwill focus on the risks to global financial stability in the current \\nmacro-financial environment—an environment that is new to \\nmany policymakers and market participants.\\nThe global economic outlook has deteriorated materially \\nsince the April 2022 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR). \\nA number of downside risks have crystallized, including higher-\\nthan-anticipated inflationary pressures, a worse-than-expected \\nslowdown in China on the back of COVID-19 outbreaks and \\nlockdowns, and additional spillovers from Russia’s invasion of \\nUkraine. As a result, the slowdown of the global economy has \\nintensified. \\nAmid extraordinary uncertainty about the outlook and stub-\\nbornly high inflation, central banks have continued to normal-\\nize policy to restore price stability. Global financial conditions \\nhave tightened in most regions since the April 2022 GFSR \\n(Figure 1)—partly an intended consequence of tighter monetary \\npolicy and partly due to rising uncertainty about the outlook \\nsince April. By contrast, conditions in China have eased some-\\nwhat, as policymakers have provided additional support to offset \\na deterioration in the economic outlook and strains in the real \\nestate sector. \\nGlobal financial stability risks have increased since the April \\n2022 GFSR, and the balance of risks is significantly skewed to \\nthe downside.

Finan-\\ncial vulnerabilities are elevated in the sovereign and nonbank \\nfinancial institution sectors, while market liquidity has deterio-\\nrated across some key asset classes. \\nInterest rates and prices of risk assets have been extremely \\nvolatile since April, reflecting heightened uncertainty about \\nthe economic and policy outlook. Risk assets sold off sharply \\nthrough June on fears that central banks would have to step \\nup the pace of policy rate hikes to fight high inflation. Emerg-\\ning market assets suffered large losses, and sovereign spreads of \\nhigh-yield emerging markets rose nearly to levels last seen in \\nMarch 2020 (Figure 3). Crypto markets also experienced extreme \\nvolatility leading to the collapse of some of the riskiest segments \\nand the unwinding of some crypto funds. \\nIn the middle of the year, as recession fears grew, risk assets \\nrallied on hopes that the monetary policy normalization cycle \\nwould end sooner than previously anticipated. These moves, how-\\never, have been unwound and risk assets have experienced further \\nlosses, as major central banks have strongly reaffirmed their \\nresolve to fight inflation and meet their price stability mandates. \\nDisagreement among investors around the most likely infla-\\ntion outcomes appears to have become more notable. In the euro \\narea, there are significant odds of both low- and high-inflation \\noutcomes, likely reflecting heightened concerns about a slow-\\ndown in aggregate growth (Figure 4). There is a risk, however, \\nthat a rapid, disorderly repricing of risk in coming months could \\ninteract with, and be amplified by, preexisting vulnerabilities and \\npoor market liquidity.\\nMarket liquidity metrics have worsened across asset classes, \\nincluding in markets that are generally highly liquid and \\namong standardized and exchange-traded products. US T rea-\\nsury bid-ask spreads have widened significantly, market depth \\nhas declined sharply, and liquidity premiums have increased \\n(Figure 5).\\nEuropean financial markets have shown strains since the April \\n2022 GFSR. Asset prices have sold off on the back of growing \\nrecession fears amid natural gas shortages and the reemergence \\nof fragmentation risks in the euro area. However, spreads of \\nsouthern European government bond yield over German yields \\ntightened after the European Central Bank’s announcement of a \\nnew tool to fight fragmentation in the euro area, the T ransmis-\\nsion Protection Instrument.

       " [' International Monetary Fund | April 2022 xi\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nGlobal financial conditions have tightened nota-\\nbly and downside risks to the economic outlook \\nhave increased as a result of the war in Ukraine \\n(Figure 1). The tightening has been particularly \\npronounced in eastern Europe and Middle East countries with \\nclose ties to Russia, reflecting lower equity valuations and \\nhigher funding costs. This has occurred just as most of the \\nworld was slowly bringing the pandemic under control and the \\nglobal economy was recovering from COVID-19.\\nFinancial stability risks have risen on several fronts, even \\nthough so far, no global systemic event affecting financial \\ninstitutions or markets has materialized. A sudden repricing of \\nrisk resulting from an intensification of the war and associated \\nescalation of sanctions may expose, and interact with, some of \\nthe vulnerabilities built up during the pandemic, leading to a \\nsharp decline in asset prices.\\nWith the sharp rise in commodity prices anticipated to \\nadd to preexisting inflation pressure, central banks are faced \\nwith a challenging trade-off between fighting record-high \\ninflation and safeguarding the post-pandemic recovery at a \\ntime of heightened uncertainty about prospects for the global \\neconomy (Figure 2).

Ongoing stress in the battered real estate sector has \\nincreased financial stability risks and added to growth pressures. \\nExtraordinary financial support measures may be necessary to ease \\npandemic-driven balance sheet pressures but would add further to \\nmedium-term debt vulnerabilities.\\nThe interlinkages between emerging market sovereigns and \\ndomestic banks have intensified over the past two years as \\nadditional government financing needs to cushion the impact of \\nthe pandemic have been mostly met by banks (see Chapter 2). \\nAs a result, bank holdings of domestic sovereign debt surged to \\nhistoric highs in 2021 (Figure 9). Distress in emerging markets \\ncould trigger an adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and \\nbanks through multiple channels—the so-called sovereign-bank \\nnexus—potentially reducing bank soundness and lending to the \\neconomy. \\nThe war in Ukraine has brought to the fore a number of \\nmedium-term structural issues policymakers will need to con-\\nfront in coming years, including the possibility that the geopoli-\\ntics of energy security may put climate transition at risk; the risk \\nof fragmentation of capital markets and possible implications for \\nthe role of the US dollar; the risk of fragmentation in payment \\nsystems and the creation of blocs of central bank digital curren-\\ncies; more widespread use of crypto assets in emerging markets; \\nand more complex and bespoke asset allocations in an effort to \\npreempt the possible imposition of sanctions.\\nThe war has made evident the urgency to cut dependency \\non carbon-intensive energy and to accelerate the transition to \\nrenewables. However, in the face of growing concerns about \\nenergy security and access to energy sources (Figure 10), the \\nenergy transition strategy may face setbacks for some time. The \\ncurrent energy crisis may alter the speed of phasing out fossil \\nfuel subsidies in emerging market and developing economies, \\nwhile rising inflation pressure may also lead authorities to \\nresort to subsidies or other forms of fiscal support to households \\nor firms.\\nCrypto asset trading volumes against some emerging market \\ncurrencies have spiked following the introduction of sanctions \\nagainst Russia and the use of capital restrictions in Russia and \\nUkraine. This is occurring against a longer-term increase in such \\ncross-border transactions, bringing to the fore the challenges of \\napplying capital flow measures and sanctions. \\nWhile technological innovation in financial activities (fintech) \\ncan support inclusive growth by strengthening competition, \\nfinancial development, and inclusion (Chapter 3), the rapid \\ngrowth of risky business segments can be a cause of concern for \\nfinancial stability when fintech firms (fintechs) are subject to less \\nstringent regulation (Figure 11).

The number of issuers trading at distressed levels \\nhas surged to nearly 25 percent of issuers (Figure 7), surpassing \\npandemic-peak levels. The deterioration in spreads, combined \\nwith the increase in US yields, has pushed financing costs well \\nabove their pre-pandemic levels for many borrowers. Markets \\nremain open for issuance at those higher levels of funding costs. \\nFlows in local currency bonds and equities have come under \\npressure, experiencing the largest weekly redemptions since \\nMarch 2020. Tighter external financial conditions on the back \\nof US monetary policy normalization and heightened geopo-\\nlitical uncertainty are likely to increase the downside risks for \\nportfolio flows (Figure 8).International claims: Russia\\nLocal claims: Russia\\nTotal: Russia\\nInternational claims: Ukraine\\nLocal claims: Ukraine\\nTotal: UkraineFigure 4.

Ongoing stress in the battered real estate sector has \\nincreased financial stability risks and added to growth pressures. \\nExtraordinary financial support measures may be necessary to ease \\npandemic-driven balance sheet pressures but would add further to \\nmedium-term debt vulnerabilities.\\nThe interlinkages between emerging market sovereigns and \\ndomestic banks have intensified over the past two years as \\nadditional government financing needs to cushion the impact of \\nthe pandemic have been mostly met by banks (see Chapter 2). \\nAs a result, bank holdings of domestic sovereign debt surged to \\nhistoric highs in 2021 (Figure 9). Distress in emerging markets \\ncould trigger an adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and \\nbanks through multiple channels—the so-called sovereign-bank \\nnexus—potentially reducing bank soundness and lending to the \\neconomy. \\nThe war in Ukraine has brought to the fore a number of \\nmedium-term structural issues policymakers will need to con-\\nfront in coming years, including the possibility that the geopoli-\\ntics of energy security may put climate transition at risk; the risk \\nof fragmentation of capital markets and possible implications for \\nthe role of the US dollar; the risk of fragmentation in payment \\nsystems and the creation of blocs of central bank digital curren-\\ncies; more widespread use of crypto assets in emerging markets; \\nand more complex and bespoke asset allocations in an effort to \\npreempt the possible imposition of sanctions.\\nThe war has made evident the urgency to cut dependency \\non carbon-intensive energy and to accelerate the transition to \\nrenewables. However, in the face of growing concerns about \\nenergy security and access to energy sources (Figure 10), the \\nenergy transition strategy may face setbacks for some time. The \\ncurrent energy crisis may alter the speed of phasing out fossil \\nfuel subsidies in emerging market and developing economies, \\nwhile rising inflation pressure may also lead authorities to \\nresort to subsidies or other forms of fiscal support to households \\nor firms.\\nCrypto asset trading volumes against some emerging market \\ncurrencies have spiked following the introduction of sanctions \\nagainst Russia and the use of capital restrictions in Russia and \\nUkraine. This is occurring against a longer-term increase in such \\ncross-border transactions, bringing to the fore the challenges of \\napplying capital flow measures and sanctions. \\nWhile technological innovation in financial activities (fintech) \\ncan support inclusive growth by strengthening competition, \\nfinancial development, and inclusion (Chapter 3), the rapid \\ngrowth of risky business segments can be a cause of concern for \\nfinancial stability when fintech firms (fintechs) are subject to less \\nstringent regulation (Figure 11).

To avoid unnecessary volatility in \\nfinancial markets, it is crucial that central banks in advanced \\neconomies provide clear guidance about the normalization pro-\\ncess while remaining data dependent. \\nEmerging markets remain vulnerable to a disorderly tighten-\\ning of global financial conditions. Many central banks have \\nalready significantly tightened policy. Further rate increases, \\nor policy normalization with respect to other measures taken \\nduring the pandemic (such as asset purchases), should con-\\ntinue as warranted according to the country-specific inflation \\nand economic outlook to anchor inflation expectations and \\npreserve policy credibility. \\nPolicymakers should tighten selected macroprudential tools \\nto tackle pockets of elevated vulnerabilities while avoiding a \\ndisorderly tightening of financial conditions. Striking a balance \\nbetween containing the buildup of vulnerabilities and avoiding \\nprocyclicality appears important given uncertainties about the \\neconomic outlook, the ongoing monetary policy normaliza-\\ntion process, and limits on fiscal space in the aftermath of \\nthe pandemic.\\nWhile taking steps to address energy security concerns, \\npolicymakers should intensify their efforts to implement the \\n2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) road \\nmap to achieve net-zero targets. They should take measures to \\nincrease the availability and lower the cost of fossil fuel alterna-\\ntives and renewables while improving energy efficiency; scale up \\nprivate finance in the transition to a greener economy; and con-\\ntinue to strengthen the climate finance information architecture.\\nPolicymakers should develop comprehensive global standards \\nfor crypto assets along the activity and risk spectrum. A more \\nrobust oversight of fintech firms and decentralized finance (DeFi) \\nplatforms is needed to take advantage of their benefits while \\nmitigating their risks. To preserve the effectiveness of capital flow \\nmanagement measures in an environment of growing usage of \\ncrypto assets, policymakers need to pursue a multifaceted policy \\nstrategy. Recent measures taken in markets and exchanges in \\nresponse to elevated volatility in commodity prices highlight the \\nneed for regulators to examine the broader implications, including \\nexchange governance mechanisms, resiliency of trading systems, \\nconcentration of risk, margin setting, and trading transparency in \\nexchange and over-the-counter markets.Share in production\\nPrice change between February 23 and March 23, 2022 (right scale)Figure 10.

In addition to the recent rise in energy and commodity prices, investors have highlighted the possibility that supply chain disruptions and shortages of labor and materials may be more persistent than currently anticipated, feeding into wage dynamics and eventually unmooring inflation expectations.\\nAsset valuations appear to be stretched in some market \\nsegments. Despite recent market turbulence, equity prices have risen further, on net, since the April 2021 GFSR, boosted by accommodative monetary policy and strong earnings. However, equity price misalignments (relative to fundamentals-based values) have remained elevated in most markets (Figure 8). Credit spreads have narrowed to below pre-pandemic levels. House prices have risen rapidly in many countries, reflecting, among other factors, the improved out-look, policy support, and shifting household preferences.\\nEmerging and frontier markets continue to face large \\nfinancing needs. Local currency government bond yields have increased in many countries on the back of domestic factors (higher inflation and fiscal concerns). The late-September increase in the US T reasury yields may exert additional pres-sure going forward, leading to higher funding costs for many countries. Inflation pressure has led many central banks to adopt a tighter monetary policy stance. The outlook for capital flows has improved, boosted by the ongoing recovery and robust global risk appetite. Monetary conditions are still broadly accommodative, with deeply negative real rates. But there is a risk that real rates may rise significantly in coming years (Figure 9). A sudden change in the monetary policy stance of advanced economies may result in a sharp tighten-ing of financial conditions, adversely affecting capital flows and exacerbating pressures in countries facing debt sustain-ability concerns.\\nDespite improvements during the recovery, financial \\nvulnerabilities remain elevated in several sectors. Among nonfinancial firms, the recovery remains uneven across coun-tries, sectors, and firm sizes. Solvency risks continue to be elevated in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic (for example, transportation and services) and in small firms (Figure 10). In China, credit conditions have tightened, particularly for firms with weak credit ratings and in provinces with weaker public finances.\\nVulnerabilities in investment funds unmasked by the \\n“dash for cash” in March 2020 remain\\n and \\nrisks are rising \\nat some other nonbank financial institutions as they reach for yield to meet nominal return targets.

While financial \\nconditions have eased further in advanced economies, on \\nnet, the sense of optimism that had propelled markets in \\nthe first half of the year faded somewhat over the summer. \\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the \\neconomic outlook amid rising virus infections and greater \\nuncertainty about the strength of the recovery, particularly \\nin emerging markets. In late September, concerns that \\ninflationary pressures may be more persistent than initially \\nanticipated have pushed nominal yields higher, in some \\ncountries entirely reversing their earlier moves. Despite some \\nimprovements since the April 2021 Global Financial Stabil-\\nity Report, financial vulnerabilities continue to be elevated \\nin a number of sectors, masked in part by massive policy \\nstimulus. Policymakers are confronted with a challenging \\ntrade-off: maintaining near-term support for the global \\neconomy while preventing unintended consequences and \\nmedium-term financial stability risks. A prolonged period of \\nextremely easy financial conditions, while needed to sustain \\nthe economic recovery, may result in overly stretched asset \\nvaluations and could fuel financial vulnerabilities. Some \\nwarning signs—for example, increased financial risk-taking \\nand rising fragilities in the nonbank financial institutions \\nsector—point to a deterioration in the underlying financial \\nstability foundations. If left unchecked, these vulnerabili-\\nties may evolve into structural legacy problems, putting \\nmedium-term growth at risk and testing the resilience of the \\nglobal financial system.\\nProgress since the April 2021 Global Financial \\nStability Report \\nFinancial conditions have eased further, on net, in \\nadvanced economies, buoyed by expectations of continued \\naccommodative monetary policy and rising risk asset valua-\\ntions.

However, equity price misalignments (relative to fundamentals-based values) have remained elevated in most markets (Figure 8). Credit spreads have narrowed to below pre-pandemic levels.

In the current environment of persistently low interest rates and ample liquidity, greater use of financial leverage to boost returns could prompt volatility in financial markets.\\nIn the banking sector, loan underwriting standards remain \\nrestrictive in many countries. According to bank loan officer surveys, this posture is expected to persist, with risks to the credit outlook as the main constraint to loan growth. A slowdown in international bank lending may pose additional downside risks to many emerging market economies (Figure 11).\\nThe crypto ecosystem continues its rapid growth \\n(Figure 12), presenting new opportunities and challenges (Chapter 2). Crypto asset exchanges pose several operational and financial integrity risks through their cross-border opera-tions. Investor protection risks loom large for crypto assets and decentralized finance. For example, stablecoins have generally poor disclosures and can be subject to runs if their reserves come into question. In emerging markets, the advent of crypto assets may be accelerating dollarization and eroding the effectiveness of existing exchange restrictions and capital control management measures. Increased trading of crypto assets by emerging market users can potentially lead to destabilizing capital flows. Emerging market and developing economies faced with these risks should prioritize strengthen-ing macro policies and consider the benefits of issuing central bank digital currencies. And globally, policymakers should work together through the G20 Cross Border Payments Roadmap to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more transparent, and inclusive.\\nPolicy Recommendations\\nWhile policy support continues to be key to sustaining the \\nongoing recovery, it should be tailored to country circum-stances given the mixed pace of the economic recovery across countries. Central banks should provide clear guidance about their future policy stance to prevent an abrupt tightening of financial conditions. If price pressures turn out to be more persistent than currently expected, monetary authorities should act decisively to prevent an unmooring of infla-tion expectations. Fiscal policy should continue to support vulnerable firms and individuals. Given policy space, fiscal measures should be targeted and tailored to country charac-teristics and needs.\\nIn light of the possible need for prolonged policy support \\nto ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery, policymakers should act decisively to address the potential unintended consequences of unprecedented measures taken during Best improvement\\nWorst deterioration\\nAverage improvementFigure 10.

A slowdown in international bank lending may pose additional downside risks to many emerging market economies (Figure 11).\\nThe crypto ecosystem continues its rapid growth \\n(Figure 12), presenting new opportunities and challenges (Chapter 2). Crypto asset exchanges pose several operational and financial integrity risks through their cross-border opera-tions. Investor protection risks loom large for crypto assets and decentralized finance. For example, stablecoins have generally poor disclosures and can be subject to runs if their reserves come into question. In emerging markets, the advent of crypto assets may be accelerating dollarization and eroding the effectiveness of existing exchange restrictions and capital control management measures. Increased trading of crypto assets by emerging market users can potentially lead to destabilizing capital flows. Emerging market and developing economies faced with these risks should prioritize strengthen-ing macro policies and consider the benefits of issuing central bank digital currencies. And globally, policymakers should work together through the G20 Cross Border Payments Roadmap to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more transparent, and inclusive.\\nPolicy Recommendations\\nWhile policy support continues to be key to sustaining the \\nongoing recovery, it should be tailored to country circum-stances given the mixed pace of the economic recovery across countries. Central banks should provide clear guidance about their future policy stance to prevent an abrupt tightening of financial conditions. If price pressures turn out to be more persistent than currently expected, monetary authorities should act decisively to prevent an unmooring of infla-tion expectations. Fiscal policy should continue to support vulnerable firms and individuals. Given policy space, fiscal measures should be targeted and tailored to country charac-teristics and needs.\\nIn light of the possible need for prolonged policy support \\nto ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery, policymakers should act decisively to address the potential unintended consequences of unprecedented measures taken during Best improvement\\nWorst deterioration\\nAverage improvementFigure 10.

Policymakers should tighten selected \\nmacroprudential tools to tackle pockets of elevated vulnerabilities while avoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions. Due to possible lags between the activation and impact of such tools, they should take early action. If such tools are not available—for example, in the nonbank financial intermediary sector—policymakers should urgently develop them. Given the challenges to designing and operationalizing macroprudential tools within existing frameworks, policymakers should also consider building buffers elsewhere to protect the financial system. In particular, policymakers should urgently address vulnerabilities in investment funds through enhanced prudential supervision and regulation to raise ex ante resilience against liquidity risks. Critically, the global nature of the investment fund business makes it imperative that further reform be achieved on an internationally coor-dinated basis through the Financial Stability Board. \\nEmerging and frontier markets remain exposed to \\nthe risk of a sudden tightening in external financing conditions. They should, while leveraging the historic general special drawing rights allocation, rebuild buf-fers as appropriate and implement structural reforms to insulate themselves from the damage from capital flow reversals and abrupt increases in funding costs.Policymakers in emerging markets must also address \\nthe challenges posed by digital dollarization. They should reverse or avert dollarization by strengthening the credibility of monetary policy, safeguarding central bank independence, and maintaining a sound fiscal position. Effective legal and regulatory measures will be necessary to disincentivize foreign currency use. Adequate frameworks for crypto asset service providers must be established, with coordination among national regulators. More generally, countries must reconsider capital flow restrictions in a more digital world, and cross-border collaboration and cooperation are needed to address the technological, legal, regulatory, and supervisory challenges (see Chapter\\n 2).\\n \\nT\\no foster the growth of the sustainable fund sector \\nand mitigate potential financial stability risks stemming from the transition to a green economy, policymakers should urgently strengthen the global climate informa-tion architecture (data, disclosures, sustainable finance classifications). Once this architecture is in place, they could also consider tools to channel savings toward transition-enhancing funds (such as financial incentives for investment in climate funds). Finally, they should conduct scenario analysis and stress testing of the investment fund sector to mitigate potential financial stability risks from the transition.'],\n",

Chinese Banks: Debt Spreads\\n(Basis points, subordinated debt)EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n International Monetary Fund | April 2021 xiA more granular firm-level assessment finds that there \\nare notable differences in performance across sectors and \\nfirm sizes. IMF staff analysis suggests that liquidity stress \\nis high at small firms in most sectors and across countries, \\nwhile solvency stress is high at small firms but also notable \\nat mid-sized and even large firms in the most affected \\nsectors (Figure 9). Chapter 1 proposes a framework to \\nassess whether firms should rely on market financing, seek \\ngovernment support, or be restructured or liquidated. \\nThe crisis has hit the commercial real estate sector hard \\n(see Chapter\\xa03). Commercial property transactions and \\nprices slumped in 2020 (Figure 10). Part of the adverse \\nimpact on the retail, office, and hotel segments could be \\nstructural, as some activities increasingly take place virtu-\\nally or are relocating outside of large cities. In the event \\nof a structural decline in demand, commercial real estate \\nfair values could drop sharply: a permanent increase in the \\nvacancy rate by 5 percentage points is estimated to result, \\non average, in a drop in fair values by about 15 percent \\nafter five years (Figure 11). Since the pandemic, price mis-\\nalignments appear to have increased. This development, if \\nit persists, could pose downside risks to growth. \\nBanks came into the pandemic with high capital and \\nliquidity buffers, thanks to regulatory reforms imple-\\nmented after the 2007–08 financial crisis, and they have \\nbeen resilient so far. But the extent to which they will \\ncontinue to provide credit through the recovery is an open \\nquestion. While growth of loans, particularly to businesses, \\nhas slowed in some countries, loan demand is expected to \\nfirm up once the recovery gains strength, especially where \\nit has been weakest. But loan officers in most coun-\\ntries do not anticipate a loosening in lending standards \\n(Figure\\xa012). The phasing out of support policies could \\nhave a significant impact on some banks, likely weighing \\non their appetite for lending. Moreover, for most banks, \\nuncertainties about credit losses and weak prospects for \\nprofitability are likely to discourage significant reduction \\nin capital buffers to support the recovery. Such constraints \\nmay be particularly worrisome for firms with limited \\nfinancing options that are more dependent on bank credit. \\nAuthorities should continue to encourage banks to use \\nbuffers, where prudent, to support the recovery.\\nOngoing policy support remains essential until a \\nsustainable and inclusive recovery takes hold to maintain \\nthe flow of credit to the economy and  prevent the pan-\\ndemic from posing a threat to the global financial system. \\nMonetary policy will need to remain accommodative until \\nmandated policy objectives are achieved. Policymakers \\nshould act swiftly to prevent financial vulnerabilities from \\nbecoming entrenched and turning into legacy problems.

They should also support balance \\nsheet repair to foster a sustainable and inclusive recovery.\\nThanks to massive policy support, the global financial \\nsystem has been resilient during the COVID-19 pan-\\ndemic and financial conditions have eased significantly \\n(Figure\\xa01). This has helped maintain the flow of credit to \\nhouseholds and firms, facilitated the recovery, and kept \\nfinancial risks at bay. The improved economic outlook has \\nclearly reduced the range of adverse outcomes, but notable \\ndownside risks to future GDP growth remain.\\nT wo overarching themes are emerging. First, unprec-\\nedented policy support may have unintended conse-\\nquences: excessive risk taking in markets is contributing \\nto stretched valuations, and rising financial vulnerabilities \\nmay become structural legacy problems if not addressed. \\nEquity markets have rallied aggressively since the third \\nquarter of 2020 on expectations of a rapid economic \\nrecovery and continued policy backstops, and they are \\nnow trading at levels meaningfully higher than those \\nsuggested by models based on fundamentals (Figure 2). \\nWhile earnings expectations have improved, historically \\nlow real risk-free rates (despite most recent increases) have \\nprovided material support so far to valuations. In the cor-\\nporate bond market, spreads have remained very tight. \\nLong-term interest rates have increased significantly, \\nespecially in the United States, reflecting in part greater \\ninvestor confidence in the outlook (Figure 3). While a GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: PREEMPTING A LEGACY OF VULNERABILITIESx International Monetary Fund | April 2021gradual rise in rates on the back of improving funda-\\nmentals may be welcome, a rapid and persistent increase, \\nespecially in real rates, may result in a repricing of risk in \\nmarkets and a sudden tightening in financial conditions. \\nSuch a tightening could interact with elevated financial \\nvulnerabilities, with repercussions for confidence and \\nendangering macro-financial stability, especially in emerg-\\ning markets.\\nSecond, the recovery is expected to be asynchronous \\nand divergent across economies (see the April 2021 World \\nEconomic Outlook). There is a risk that financial condi-\\ntions in emerging market economies may tighten mark-\\nedly, especially if policymakers in advanced economies \\ntake steps toward policy normalization. A less favorable \\nfinancial environment may result in large portfolio out-\\nflows and pose a significant challenge to some emerging \\nand frontier market economies, given the large financ-\\ning needs they face this year. IMF staff analysis points to \\na continued improvement in the outlook for portfolio \\nflows, primarily reflecting easier global financial condi-\\ntions (Figure 4). Nevertheless, countries with weaker \\nfundamentals or limited access to COVID-19 vaccines \\nare vulnerable. The sovereign-bank nexus has worsened \\nin emerging markets as domestic banks have absorbed \\nthe bulk of increases in domestic debt (Figure 5). For \\nmany frontier market economies, market access remains \\nimpaired. \\nChina has recovered more rapidly than other countries, \\nbut at the cost of a further buildup in vulnerabilities, \\nparticularly risky corporate debt. Financial conditions \\nmay become less favorable amid expectations for policy \\ntightening and new measures to impose discipline on \\nbanks, local governments, and property developers, as well \\nas rising uncertainty about implicit guarantees. Fund-\\ning conditions for capital instruments have tightened for \\nweaker, smaller banks (Figure\\xa06). National authorities \\nface a delicate but urgent challenge in unwinding implicit \\nguarantees—a task that must be handled delicately given \\nthe potential for disorderly repricing.\\nThe global corporate sector has been hit hard by the \\npandemic. Extraordinary policy support has helped miti-\\ngate its impact. Large firms with market access have taken \\nadvantage of favorable conditions to issue debt and cope \\nwith liquidity pressures (Figures 7 and 8). But the buildup \\nin corporate leverage resulting from easy financial condi-\\ntions poses a dilemma for policymakers, as the short-term \\nboost to economic activity must be weighed against an \\nincrease in vulnerabilities and downside risks to growth \\ndown the road (see Chapter\\xa02).

Chinese Banks: Debt Spreads\\n(Basis points, subordinated debt)EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n International Monetary Fund | April 2021 xiA more granular firm-level assessment finds that there \\nare notable differences in performance across sectors and \\nfirm sizes. IMF staff analysis suggests that liquidity stress \\nis high at small firms in most sectors and across countries, \\nwhile solvency stress is high at small firms but also notable \\nat mid-sized and even large firms in the most affected \\nsectors (Figure 9). Chapter 1 proposes a framework to \\nassess whether firms should rely on market financing, seek \\ngovernment support, or be restructured or liquidated. \\nThe crisis has hit the commercial real estate sector hard \\n(see Chapter\\xa03). Commercial property transactions and \\nprices slumped in 2020 (Figure 10). Part of the adverse \\nimpact on the retail, office, and hotel segments could be \\nstructural, as some activities increasingly take place virtu-\\nally or are relocating outside of large cities. In the event \\nof a structural decline in demand, commercial real estate \\nfair values could drop sharply: a permanent increase in the \\nvacancy rate by 5 percentage points is estimated to result, \\non average, in a drop in fair values by about 15 percent \\nafter five years (Figure 11). Since the pandemic, price mis-\\nalignments appear to have increased. This development, if \\nit persists, could pose downside risks to growth. \\nBanks came into the pandemic with high capital and \\nliquidity buffers, thanks to regulatory reforms imple-\\nmented after the 2007–08 financial crisis, and they have \\nbeen resilient so far. But the extent to which they will \\ncontinue to provide credit through the recovery is an open \\nquestion. While growth of loans, particularly to businesses, \\nhas slowed in some countries, loan demand is expected to \\nfirm up once the recovery gains strength, especially where \\nit has been weakest. But loan officers in most coun-\\ntries do not anticipate a loosening in lending standards \\n(Figure\\xa012). The phasing out of support policies could \\nhave a significant impact on some banks, likely weighing \\non their appetite for lending. Moreover, for most banks, \\nuncertainties about credit losses and weak prospects for \\nprofitability are likely to discourage significant reduction \\nin capital buffers to support the recovery. Such constraints \\nmay be particularly worrisome for firms with limited \\nfinancing options that are more dependent on bank credit. \\nAuthorities should continue to encourage banks to use \\nbuffers, where prudent, to support the recovery.\\nOngoing policy support remains essential until a \\nsustainable and inclusive recovery takes hold to maintain \\nthe flow of credit to the economy and  prevent the pan-\\ndemic from posing a threat to the global financial system. \\nMonetary policy will need to remain accommodative until \\nmandated policy objectives are achieved. Policymakers \\nshould act swiftly to prevent financial vulnerabilities from \\nbecoming entrenched and turning into legacy problems.

If such tools \\nare not available (such as in some  segments of the non-\\nbank financial intermediation sector), policymakers should \\nswiftly develop them. Given the challenges to designing \\nand operationalizing macroprudential tools within existing \\nframeworks, policymakers should also consider building \\nbuffers elsewhere to protect the financial system. \\nIn emerging and frontier market economies, countries \\nwith market access should take advantage of favorable financ-\\ning conditions to improve the composition of their debt \\nstructure. Countries with limited market access will likely \\nneed additional assistance from the international commu-\\nnity. Other countries facing significant difficulties with debt \\nburdens could benefit from deeper restructuring. The Group \\nof T wenty (G20) Common Framework for Debt T reatments \\ncan help address debt vulnerabilities. Rebuilding buffers, \\nwhere possible, should be a key priority to prepare for any \\nsudden price adjustments and reversal of capital flows.\\nRepairing corporate balance sheets should be a priority \\nto enable a sustainable and inclusive recovery. Direct and \\nfirm-specific targeted policy support may be needed for \\nviable firms whose market access is limited and that are \\nfacing temporary liquidity or solvency risks. Given very \\nlimited fiscal resources in some jurisdictions, policymak-\\ners should also expedite reforms to enhance resolution \\nframeworks, including the development of distressed debt \\nand nonperforming loan markets.\\nOnce the extent of structural changes in the commer-\\ncial real estate sector becomes clearer, targeted macropru-\\ndential policy tools (such as limits on the loan-to-value or \\ndebt-service-coverage ratios) should be deployed to reduce \\ndownside risks to growth. The optimal timing of such \\npolicy measures should depend on the economy-specific \\npace of the recovery and the degree of financial vulner-\\nabilities in the commercial real estate sector. Broadening \\nthe macroprudential toolkit to cover nonbank financial \\ninstitutions active in some commercial real estate funding \\nmarkets will also be crucial.\\nIn the financial sector, regulatory guidance on provi-\\nsioning for expected losses to avoid excessive procyclicality \\nremains pertinent, but such provisioning should be subject \\nto supervisory scrutiny. Restrictions on capital distributions \\nshould be maintained or be relaxed only progressively in \\ncountries overcoming the pandemic, subject to supervisory \\nstress tests to ensure that banks remain well capitalized.Interquartile range MedianFigure 11.

Unprecedented and timely policy response \\nhas helped maintain the flow of credit to the economy and \\navoid adverse macro-financial feedback loops, creating a \\nbridge to recovery.\\n• However, vulnerabilities are rising, intensifying financial stabil-\\nity concerns in some countries. Vulnerabilities have increased \\nin the nonfinancial corporate sector, as firms have taken on \\nmore debt to cope with cash shortages, and in the sovereign \\nsector, as fiscal deficits have widened to support the economy.\\n• As the crisis unfolds, corporate liquidity pressures may morph \\ninto insolvencies, especially if the recovery is delayed. Small \\nand medium-sized enterprises are more vulnerable than \\nlarge firms with access to capital markets. The future path of \\ndefaults will ultimately be shaped by the extent of continued \\npolicy support and the pace of the recovery, which is expected \\nto be uneven across sectors and countries.• While the global banking system is well capitalized, there \\nis a weak tail of banks, and some banking systems may \\nexperience capital shortfalls in the October 2020 World \\nEconomic Outlook adverse scenario even with the currently \\ndeployed policy measures.\\n• Some emerging and frontier market economies face financ-\\ning challenges, which may tip some of them into debt \\ndistress or lead to financial instability and may require \\nofficial support.\\n• As economies reopen, accommodative policies will be \\nessential to ensure that the recovery takes hold and \\nbecomes sustainable—see the following Policy Road Map. \\nThe post-pandemic financial reform agenda should focus \\non strengthening the regulatory framework for the non-\\nbank financial sector and stepping up prudential supervi-\\nsion to contain excessive risk taking in a lower-for-longer \\ninterest-rate environment. \\nMonetary and Financial Policy Road Map after the Great Lockdown \\nGradual Reopening under Uncertainty\\nMonetary policy—Maintain accommodation to support the recovery\\nLiquidity support—Maintain support but adjust pricing to incentivize a gradual exit\\nCredit provision—Encourage banks to use capital and liquidity buffers to continue lending\\nNonfinancial private sector—Extend moratoria on debt service only if necessary to prevent widespread insolvencies, support \\nviable firms through restructuring and efficient out-of-court workouts to reduce the debt burden, as well as by providing \\nsolvency support (as appropriate)\\nMultilateral support—Provide support to emerging and frontier market economies facing financing difficulties\\nPandemic under Control\\nMonetary policy—Maintain accommodation until monetary policy objectives are achieved\\nLiquidity support—Gradually withdraw\\nCredit provision—Require banks to gradually rebuild capital and liquidity buffers, develop credible plans to reduce problem \\nassets, and create markets for problem assets\\nNonfinancial private sector—Recapitalize, restructure, or resolve nonviable firms\\nGreen recovery—Encourage more proactive management of climate-related risks and green investments\\nDigitalization—Encourage greater digital investment to enhance financial sector efficiency and inclusion\\nPost-pandemic Financial Reform Agenda\\nNonbank financial sector—Strengthen the regulatory framework to address vulnerabilities exposed during the coronavirus \\ndisease (COVID-19) crisis\\nLower for longer—Implement prudential measures to contain risk-taking in the lower-for-longer interest-rate environmentGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: BRIDGE TO RECOVERYxii International Monetary Fund | October 2020Confronted with a global health and economic crisis, \\npolicymakers have taken extraordinary measures to \\nprotect people, the economy, and the financial system. \\nHowever, prospects for recovery remain highly uncertain \\nand will depend on the availability of reliable COVID-19 \\ntreatments and vaccines. In addition, many countries have \\nentered the crisis with elevated preexisting vulnerabilities \\nin some sectors—asset management, nonfinancial firms, \\nand sovereigns—and vulnerabilities are rising, represent-\\ning potential headwinds for the recovery (Figure 1). \\nSince the June 2020 Global Financial Stability \\nUpdate, global financial conditions have remained \\naccommodative on the back of continued policy sup-\\nport. In advanced economies, low interest rates and a \\nrecovery in risk asset markets have continued to sup-\\nport further easing in financial conditions (Figure 2). \\nFinancial conditions have generally eased also in \\nemerging markets (excluding China) over the same \\nperiod, although external costs for many countries are \\nstill above pre–COVID-19 levels (Figure 2). In China, \\nfinancial conditions have remained broadly stable, as \\nauthorities have scaled back expectations for further \\ninterest rate reductions amid improving economic activ-\\nity and rising financial sector risks.\\nAlthough the sharp easing of financial conditions \\nsince late March has helped prevent a financial crisis and \\ncushion the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, the \\ndeterioration of the economic outlook has shifted the \\nexpected distribution of global growth in 2020 deeply \\ninto negative territory (Figure 3). Looking ahead, the \\nglobal economy is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in \\n2021, according to the October 2020 World Economic \\nOutlook (WEO). This expected rebound and easy finan-\\ncial conditions imply that the odds of negative growth \\nnext year are low, though the balance of risks is tilted to \\nthe downside (Figure 3).\\nUnprecedented policy actions taken in response \\nto the pandemic have been successful in boosting \\ninvestor sentiment and maintaining the flow of credit \\nto the economy. To cope with cash flow pressures, \\nfirms have stepped up bond issuance, tapped bank \\ncredit lines (most notably in the United States), and \\ntaken advantage of government-guaranteed loans (see \\nChapter 3).\\nHard currency bond issuance in emerging markets \\nhas been strong as well. Aggregate portfolio flows have \\nrecovered from their March lows, though about half of \\nemerging market economies have continued to experi-\\nence outflows over the past three months.

Firms in sectors most \\naffected by the pandemic, however, are facing weaker \\ngrowth prospects and greater liquidity strains, and hence a \\nhigher risk of default and insolvency. Small and medium-\\nsized enterprises, which are generally more vulnerable, \\ncould be a significant channel for transmission of the \\neconomic shock. Furthermore, small and medium-sized \\nenterprises tend to dominate some of the most contact-\\nintensive sectors (hotels, restaurants, entertainment), \\nwhich have taken a beating from COVID-19. \\nBanks entered the COVID-19 crisis with signifi-\\ncantly stronger capital and liquidity buffers than they \\nhad in 2008–09. This has allowed them to continue \\nto provide credit to the economy. Policies aimed at \\nsupporting borrowers and encouraging banks to use \\nthe flexibility built into the regulatory framework have \\nlikely supported banks’ willingness and ability to lend. \\nHowever, some banks are already starting to tighten \\ntheir lending standards, which could have adverse \\nimplications for the recovery. A forward-looking \\nanalysis of bank solvency in 29 countries (not includ-\\ning China) shows that in the October 2020 WEO \\nbaseline scenario most banks will be able to absorb \\nlosses and maintain capital buffers above the minimum \\ncapital requirements (see Chapter 4). In the WEO \\nadverse scenario characterized by a deeper recession \\nand a weaker recovery, a sizable weak tail of banks \\ncould see their capital buffers depleted to the levels \\nthat could constrain their lending capacity (Figure 9). \\nThese weak banks’ capital shortfall relative to broad \\nregulatory requirements—which include the counter-\\ncyclical capital buffer, capital conservation buffer, and \\nsystemic buffers—could reach $220 billion, even after \\naccounting for borrower- and bank-oriented mitigation \\npolicies (see Chapter 4).\\nNonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) have entered \\nthe crisis with elevated vulnerabilities (Figure 10). \\nThey have managed to cope with the pandemic-\\ninduced market turmoil thanks to policy support, but \\nfragilities remain high. Asset managers, for example, \\ncould be forced into fire sales if portfolio losses are \\nlarger and redemptions last longer than during the \\nMarch sell-off. NBFIs play a growing role in credit \\nmarkets, including riskier segments, and the increased \\nlinks between NBFIs and banks imply that fragilities \\ncould spread through the financial system.ICR < 1 in 2019:Q4\\nICR < 1 in 2020:Q2 and an increase in net debt between Q4 and Q2ICR < 1 in 2020:Q2Figure 7.

Equity markets \\nin China and the United States have outperformed other \\nmarkets, driven by technology stocks (dark and light \\ngreen bars, Figure 5), notwithstanding the market correc-\\ntion in September. More contact-intensive sectors (hotels, \\nrestaurants, leisure) have been hurt by lockdowns and \\nsocial distancing. The underperformance of the energy \\nand financial sectors (red and yellow bars, Figure\\xa05) \\nreflects investors’ assessments of weaker growth prospects.\\nThe disconnect between rising market valuations \\nand the evolution of the economy, discussed in the \\nJune 2020 Global Financial Stability Update, persists. \\nFor example, analysis of year-to-date US stock market \\nperformance shows that a sharp decline in the corpo-\\nrate earnings outlook has been more than offset by \\nlower risk-free rates and a compression of the equity \\nrisk premium, reflecting central banks’ policy rate \\ncuts and other measures that have boosted investor \\nsentiment despite higher economic uncertainty (see \\nChapter\\xa01). Similarly, the decline in corporate bond \\nyields has been driven by the fall in risk-free rates and \\nthe compression in credit spreads—in many cases \\nbelow values estimated to be consistent with economic \\nfundamentals (Figure 6). The spread compression can \\nbe partly attributed to policy support and, in the case \\nof emerging markets, it can also be traced to policy \\neasing by central banks in advanced economies. If mar-\\nkets believe that policy support will be maintained or \\nscaled up in response to deterioration in the economic \\noutlook, current risk asset valuations could be sus-\\ntained for some time. However, if investors reassess the \\nscope for policy support or if the recovery is delayed, \\nthe odds of a sharp adjustment may rise. \\nNonfinancial firms have come under significant liquid-\\nity strains following the COVID-19 outbreak. More \\nvulnerable firms—with weaker solvency and liquidity \\npositions, as well as smaller firms—have experienced \\ngreater financial stress than their peers in the early stages \\nof the crisis (see Chapter\\xa03). To cope with cash shortages, \\nmany firms—notably those whose earnings fell short of \\ntheir interest expenses—have increased their borrowing \\n(Figure 7), adding to the already high corporate debt \\nlevels in several economies (Figure 8).

Firms in sectors most \\naffected by the pandemic, however, are facing weaker \\ngrowth prospects and greater liquidity strains, and hence a \\nhigher risk of default and insolvency. Small and medium-\\nsized enterprises, which are generally more vulnerable, \\ncould be a significant channel for transmission of the \\neconomic shock. Furthermore, small and medium-sized \\nenterprises tend to dominate some of the most contact-\\nintensive sectors (hotels, restaurants, entertainment), \\nwhich have taken a beating from COVID-19. \\nBanks entered the COVID-19 crisis with signifi-\\ncantly stronger capital and liquidity buffers than they \\nhad in 2008–09. This has allowed them to continue \\nto provide credit to the economy. Policies aimed at \\nsupporting borrowers and encouraging banks to use \\nthe flexibility built into the regulatory framework have \\nlikely supported banks’ willingness and ability to lend. \\nHowever, some banks are already starting to tighten \\ntheir lending standards, which could have adverse \\nimplications for the recovery. A forward-looking \\nanalysis of bank solvency in 29 countries (not includ-\\ning China) shows that in the October 2020 WEO \\nbaseline scenario most banks will be able to absorb \\nlosses and maintain capital buffers above the minimum \\ncapital requirements (see Chapter 4). In the WEO \\nadverse scenario characterized by a deeper recession \\nand a weaker recovery, a sizable weak tail of banks \\ncould see their capital buffers depleted to the levels \\nthat could constrain their lending capacity (Figure 9). \\nThese weak banks’ capital shortfall relative to broad \\nregulatory requirements—which include the counter-\\ncyclical capital buffer, capital conservation buffer, and \\nsystemic buffers—could reach $220 billion, even after \\naccounting for borrower- and bank-oriented mitigation \\npolicies (see Chapter 4).\\nNonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) have entered \\nthe crisis with elevated vulnerabilities (Figure 10). \\nThey have managed to cope with the pandemic-\\ninduced market turmoil thanks to policy support, but \\nfragilities remain high. Asset managers, for example, \\ncould be forced into fire sales if portfolio losses are \\nlarger and redemptions last longer than during the \\nMarch sell-off. NBFIs play a growing role in credit \\nmarkets, including riskier segments, and the increased \\nlinks between NBFIs and banks imply that fragilities \\ncould spread through the financial system.ICR < 1 in 2019:Q4\\nICR < 1 in 2020:Q2 and an increase in net debt between Q4 and Q2ICR < 1 in 2020:Q2Figure 7.

Vulner-\\nabilities have increased across multiple sectors, with \\n6 out of 29 jurisdictions with systemically important \\nfinancial sectors now showing elevated vulnerabili-\\nties in the corporate, banking, and sovereign sectors \\n(Figure 11).\\nBecause of the pandemic, the financing needs of \\nemerging markets have risen sharply. Concerns about \\nnew debt supply and weak domestic fundamentals may \\nhave curtailed demand for local currency bonds from \\nforeign investors (Figure 12), especially where they \\nhold large shares of debt and where the domestic inves-\\ntor base may not be sufficiently deep. Some emerging \\nmarket central banks purchased a substantial share \\nof bonds in the secondary market to stabilize market \\nconditions (see Chapter\\xa02). Frontier market economies \\nface even greater financing challenges, as the COVID-\\n19 shock pushed borrowing costs for many to prohibi-\\ntive levels—calling for official support. \\nAs policymakers build a bridge to recovery, poli-\\ncies will have to adjust, depending on the evolution of \\nthe pandemic and the pace of the economic rebound \\n(see Policy Road Map in the at-a-glance box at the \\nbeginning of this Executive Summary). At each step, \\npolicymakers should be mindful of intertemporal \\ntrade-offs and of unintended consequences—the ben-\\nefits of using available buffers today should be carefully \\nbalanced against the possible need for further support \\nin the future, as well as the risk of exacerbating future \\nvulnerabilities.\\nAs economies reopen, continued monetary policy \\naccommodation and targeted liquidity support will \\nbe essential for sustaining the recovery. A robust \\nframework for debt restructuring will be critical for \\nreducing debt overhangs and resolving nonviable \\nfirms. Low-income countries with financing difficul-\\nties may require multilateral support. Despite its \\nadverse effect on firms’ environmental performance, \\nthe COVID-19 crisis also presents an opportunity \\nto engineer a transition to a greener economy (see \\nChapter 5). \\nAfter the pandemic is fully under control, policy \\nsupport can be gradually withdrawn and policy priori-\\nties should focus on rebuilding bank buffers, strength-\\nening regulation of nonbank financial institutions \\nand stepping up prudential supervision to contain \\nexcessive risk taking in a lower-for-longer interest-rate \\nenvironment.Other domestic\\nNonresidents\\nDomestic banks\\nCentral bank\\nTotal change in LC\\ndebt outstandingFigure 12.

Indeed, the share of firms with \\nlow cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with \\nfewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including \\nin emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions \\n(Figure ES.3). This rebound is especially evident among small \\nand medium firms. Likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue \\nto face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in \\nhousing activity and a further decline in home prices. Global \\nreal house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major \\ncentral banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. In \\nadvanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the \\nfirst quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller \\ndecline of about 2.4 percent. Countries with a large share of \\nfloating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic \\naverage recorded double-digit declines in home prices.\\nGiven the size and concentration of commercial real estate \\n(CRE) and its strong connections with the broader financial \\nsystem and the real economy, stress in that sector can have \\nsignificant financial stability implications. As a share of GDP , \\nCRE-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of GDP in \\nEurope and 18 percent in the United States. Concerns about \\nthe risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding \\nsources become less available for CRE borrowers needing to refi-\\nnance—banks have reported tighter lending standards, private \\nequity fundraising activity has slowed sharply (Figure ES.4), \\nand the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has \\ngone tepid. The prospect of interest rates remaining higher for \\nlonger, combined with declining property valuations, will keep \\nrefinancing conditions strained in the CRE sector.\\nIn China, weakening economic momentum, a deepening \\nproperty sector downturn, and growing strains on local gov-\\nernment financing weigh heavily on market sentiment. The \\nrenminbi has faced notable downward pressure as equity prices \\nhave fallen sharply. Disinflationary pressures have grown, \\nprompting the People’s Bank of China to cut policy rates—one \\nof the few central banks to ease monetary policy. However, such \\neasing and other announced stimulus measures have not yet \\nrestored confidence among businesses, consumers, and, impor-\\ntantly, homebuyers. Stronger private property developers and \\neven state-owned developers have experienced materially lower \\nhome sales volumes in recent months (Figure ES.5), and a large \\nprivate developer missed interest payments on its bonds due \\nin August.

Indeed, the share of firms with \\nlow cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with \\nfewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including \\nin emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions \\n(Figure ES.3). This rebound is especially evident among small \\nand medium firms. Likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue \\nto face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in \\nhousing activity and a further decline in home prices. Global \\nreal house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major \\ncentral banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. In \\nadvanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the \\nfirst quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller \\ndecline of about 2.4 percent. Countries with a large share of \\nfloating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic \\naverage recorded double-digit declines in home prices.\\nGiven the size and concentration of commercial real estate \\n(CRE) and its strong connections with the broader financial \\nsystem and the real economy, stress in that sector can have \\nsignificant financial stability implications. As a share of GDP , \\nCRE-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of GDP in \\nEurope and 18 percent in the United States. Concerns about \\nthe risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding \\nsources become less available for CRE borrowers needing to refi-\\nnance—banks have reported tighter lending standards, private \\nequity fundraising activity has slowed sharply (Figure ES.4), \\nand the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has \\ngone tepid. The prospect of interest rates remaining higher for \\nlonger, combined with declining property valuations, will keep \\nrefinancing conditions strained in the CRE sector.\\nIn China, weakening economic momentum, a deepening \\nproperty sector downturn, and growing strains on local gov-\\nernment financing weigh heavily on market sentiment. The \\nrenminbi has faced notable downward pressure as equity prices \\nhave fallen sharply. Disinflationary pressures have grown, \\nprompting the People’s Bank of China to cut policy rates—one \\nof the few central banks to ease monetary policy. However, such \\neasing and other announced stimulus measures have not yet \\nrestored confidence among businesses, consumers, and, impor-\\ntantly, homebuyers.

On the other hand, investment funds with \\nshorter funding structures, especially those providing \\ndaily liquidity, could face redemption pressure from \\ntheir investors, as higher interest rates reduce the value \\nof their fixed-income assets. Those using leveraged \\ninvestment strategies predicated on swift disinflation \\nmay be forced to unwind positions should inflation \\nstay doggedly high.\\nChapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation \\ninvestment needs in emerging market and developing \\neconomies (EMDEs) are estimated to reach about $2 \\ntrillion per year. The private sector is key to financing \\nthe required investments in EMDEs, given limited fis-\\ncal space and challenging market conditions. By 2030, \\nthe share of private finance must increase to about \\n80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in \\nEMDEs, and the proportion should be even greater in \\nEMDEs outside of China (Figure ES.8). \\nPolicy Recommendations\\nUltimately, sustainable economic growth requires \\nboth price and financial stability. Central banks must \\nremain determined in their fight against inflation until \\nthere is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably \\ntoward targets, although the stance of monetary policy \\nshould reflect a country-specific pace of economic \\nrecovery and disinflationary processes. Communication \\nremains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. \\nProgress on inflation in a number of emerging market \\neconomies has been notable, but central banks should \\nbe cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. \\nCountries should integrate their policies, including, \\nwhere applicable, within the Integrated Policy Frame-\\nwork, the IMF’s macrofinancial framework for countries \\nto manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows \\namid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the \\nforeign exchange environment. Optimal policy combi-\\nnations depend on the nature of the shock and country-\\nspecific characteristics. Any response measures should be \\npart of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic \\nimbalances and allows for needed adjustments. \\nSovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, \\nfrontier markets, and low-income countries should \\nstrengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their \\nhigh debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue \\nwith creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support \\nfrom the international community. If applicable, the \\nGroup of T wenty Common Framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, \\nincluding in preemptive restructurings. Bilateral and \\nprivate sector creditors should find ways to coordinate \\npreemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly \\nhard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. \\nWhere feasible, refinancing or liability management \\noperations should be executed to rebuild buffers. \\nIn China, robust policies to restore confidence in \\nthe real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of \\nnegative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, \\nand local governments. Priority should be given to \\nfacilitating the completion of housing projects, which \\ncould stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and \\nthe timely resolution and restructuring of troubled \\nproperty developers. Easing monetary policy further \\nand reorienting fiscal support toward households are \\nnecessary to support economic growth. A comprehen-\\nsive strategy is needed to address the LGFV debt issue \\nto restore LGFVs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve \\nsustainable levels of local government debt. Although \\nauthorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate \\nsystemic risks emanating from the asset management \\nsector, further progress is needed to address risky \\nexposures to real estate and LGFVs and liquidity mis-\\nmatches between their assets and liabilities. For banks, \\nmaintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing \\nout forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss \\nrecognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak \\nbanks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. \\nThe sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial \\nsystem and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions \\nhighlights the urgent need to implement international \\nstandards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, \\nassess whether specific features of these standards \\nperformed as intended during the recent turmoil, and \\nenhance supervision where necessary. Adequate mini-\\nmum capital and liquidity requirements across large \\nand small institutions alike are essential to contain \\nfinancial stability risks. Authorities should be more \\nprepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in \\nbanks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to \\naccess central bank facilities, and strengthening where \\nneeded their bank resolution regimes and preparedness \\nto deploy them. \\nNational authorities should deploy stringent stress \\ntests to estimate the potential effects of diminished \\nborrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline \\nin residential real estate prices on household balance \\nsheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions.

In emerging market economies, progress on lowering \\ninflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early \\nrate hikes becoming apparent. However, there are discrepancies \\nacross regions. Widening divergence of inflation and economic \\noutlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of \\nthe global monetary policy. \\nYet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, \\nwhereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is \\navoided, has fueled asset valuation since the April 2023 Global \\nFinancial Stability Report. Despite the declines in equity prices \\nsince September, driven by rising long-term real rates, finan-\\ncial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net \\n(Figure ES.1). Taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, \\nstock prices in Europe and the United States have climbed \\nabout 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit \\nspreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of \\nthis rate hike cycle. In Japan, equities have outperformed other \\nadvanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-\\netary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. \\nEmerging markets such as Chile, Hungary, India, Mexico, and \\nPoland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-\\ntent with the appreciation of most major emerging market \\ncurrencies in the first half of the year. Upside surprises to the \\ninflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, \\nresulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. \\nWhile acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, \\na weak tail of banks remains in some countries. In addition, \\ncracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could \\nturn into worrisome fault lines. In the event of an abrupt \\ntightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could \\nbe triggered and again test the resilience of the global finan-\\ncial system. Most notably, the global credit cycle has started \\nto turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and \\ncredit growth slows. The IMF’s growth-at-risk measure summa-\\nrizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are \\nskewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in April 2023 \\n(Figure ES.2). In a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing \\ndoes not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and \\nfinancial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the \\ngrowth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more \\nfirmly skewed to the downside.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nUnited States\\nEuro area\\nOther advanced economies\\nChina\\nEmerging markets excluding ChinaApr.\\n2023\\nGFSRFigure ES.1.

Indeed, the share of firms with \\nlow cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with \\nfewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including \\nin emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions \\n(Figure ES.3). This rebound is especially evident among small \\nand medium firms. Likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue \\nto face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in \\nhousing activity and a further decline in home prices. Global \\nreal house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major \\ncentral banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. In \\nadvanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the \\nfirst quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller \\ndecline of about 2.4 percent. Countries with a large share of \\nfloating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic \\naverage recorded double-digit declines in home prices.\\nGiven the size and concentration of commercial real estate \\n(CRE) and its strong connections with the broader financial \\nsystem and the real economy, stress in that sector can have \\nsignificant financial stability implications. As a share of GDP , \\nCRE-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of GDP in \\nEurope and 18 percent in the United States. Concerns about \\nthe risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding \\nsources become less available for CRE borrowers needing to refi-\\nnance—banks have reported tighter lending standards, private \\nequity fundraising activity has slowed sharply (Figure ES.4), \\nand the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has \\ngone tepid. The prospect of interest rates remaining higher for \\nlonger, combined with declining property valuations, will keep \\nrefinancing conditions strained in the CRE sector.\\nIn China, weakening economic momentum, a deepening \\nproperty sector downturn, and growing strains on local gov-\\nernment financing weigh heavily on market sentiment. The \\nrenminbi has faced notable downward pressure as equity prices \\nhave fallen sharply. Disinflationary pressures have grown, \\nprompting the People’s Bank of China to cut policy rates—one \\nof the few central banks to ease monetary policy. However, such \\neasing and other announced stimulus measures have not yet \\nrestored confidence among businesses, consumers, and, impor-\\ntantly, homebuyers.

In addition, a major \\nasset manager, which suspended payments and redemptions on \\nits wealth management and trust products, has raised concerns \\nabout further financial stress if the public were to lose confi-\\ndence in investment products.\\nInvestors continue to differentiate between emerging market \\neconomies with stronger fundamentals and policy buffers and \\nthose considered less resilient and more vulnerable to shocks. \\nMost emerging market sovereign credit spreads have remained \\nnarrow despite the continued tightening of monetary policy \\nand higher yields (Figure ES.6). However, the gap between the \\ninvestment-grade and high-yield segments of emerging market \\nsovereign debt markets remains wide. Repeated credit down-\\ngrades since the pandemic have pushed the average frontier \\nsovereign rating lower, driving implied spreads and financing \\ncosts higher across many emerging market economies. \\nAs the primary lenders in the global economy, banks are \\nexpected to deal with greater credit costs as higher interest \\nrates reduce borrowers’ ability to repay loans. In aggregate, the \\nbanking system appears to have prudently added provisions for \\nmore defaults, and loan-loss reserves seem adequate to cover \\nnonperforming loans in many countries. Higher rates should \\nalso support net interest margins on new bank loans. That said, \\nhistory has shown that credit exposures can deteriorate rapidly, \\nand loan demand can plummet when an economy enters a \\nrecession, affecting bank profitability. Chapter 2 presents the \\nIMF’s assessment of the quantum of banks vulnerable to higher \\ninflation and interest rates using two new approaches. The \\nassessment conducts an enhanced version of the IMF’s global \\nstress test, complemented by a new forward-looking monitoring \\nframework that incorporates analyst forecasts of key risk indica-\\ntors—bank balance sheet, valuation, and profitability metrics. \\nBoth approaches indicate the presence of a notably weak tail of \\nbanks. The global stress test shows a wide set of banks will suffer \\ncapital losses under an adverse stagflationary scenario, including \\nseveral systemically important institutions in China, Europe, \\nand the United States (Figure ES.7). This finding is consistent \\nwith the key risk indicators which project that some Chinese \\nand US banks are likely to remain under pressure given lower \\nexpected earnings and the depressed price-to-book ratios of \\nChinese banks.\\nAn environment of high interest rates is likely to benefit some \\nnonbank financial intermediaries while challenging the resilience \\nof others.

On the other hand, investment funds with \\nshorter funding structures, especially those providing \\ndaily liquidity, could face redemption pressure from \\ntheir investors, as higher interest rates reduce the value \\nof their fixed-income assets.

The private sector is key to financing \\nthe required investments in EMDEs, given limited fis-\\ncal space and challenging market conditions. By 2030, \\nthe share of private finance must increase to about \\n80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in \\nEMDEs, and the proportion should be even greater in \\nEMDEs outside of China (Figure ES.8). \\nPolicy Recommendations\\nUltimately, sustainable economic growth requires \\nboth price and financial stability. Central banks must \\nremain determined in their fight against inflation until \\nthere is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably \\ntoward targets, although the stance of monetary policy \\nshould reflect a country-specific pace of economic \\nrecovery and disinflationary processes. Communication \\nremains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. \\nProgress on inflation in a number of emerging market \\neconomies has been notable, but central banks should \\nbe cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. \\nCountries should integrate their policies, including, \\nwhere applicable, within the Integrated Policy Frame-\\nwork, the IMF’s macrofinancial framework for countries \\nto manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows \\namid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the \\nforeign exchange environment. Optimal policy combi-\\nnations depend on the nature of the shock and country-\\nspecific characteristics. Any response measures should be \\npart of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic \\nimbalances and allows for needed adjustments. \\nSovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, \\nfrontier markets, and low-income countries should \\nstrengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their \\nhigh debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue \\nwith creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support \\nfrom the international community. If applicable, the \\nGroup of T wenty Common Framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, \\nincluding in preemptive restructurings. Bilateral and \\nprivate sector creditors should find ways to coordinate \\npreemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly \\nhard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. \\nWhere feasible, refinancing or liability management \\noperations should be executed to rebuild buffers. \\nIn China, robust policies to restore confidence in \\nthe real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of \\nnegative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, \\nand local governments. Priority should be given to \\nfacilitating the completion of housing projects, which \\ncould stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and \\nthe timely resolution and restructuring of troubled \\nproperty developers. Easing monetary policy further \\nand reorienting fiscal support toward households are \\nnecessary to support economic growth. A comprehen-\\nsive strategy is needed to address the LGFV debt issue \\nto restore LGFVs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve \\nsustainable levels of local government debt.

But overall finan-\\ncial stability risks remain elevated because global politi-cal and policy uncertainties are opening new channels for negative spillovers. A sudden reversal of market sentiment or a global shift toward inward-looking pro-tectionist policies could reignite capital outflows and hurt growth prospects, testing the resilience of these economies. \\nCountries with strong international financial and \\ntrade links in particular could be challenged by tighter global financial conditions or adverse trade measures. These risks could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in the corporate sector and could increase the debt at risk of the weakest firms by $130–$230 billion. A sharp turn away from the current supportive external environment could reinforce risks in countries whose weakest banks are challenged to maintain asset quality and adequately provision for bad loans after long credit booms. \\nChina faces mounting risks to financial stability as \\ncredit continues to rise rapidly. China’s bank assets are now more than triple its GDP , and other nonbank financial institutions also have heightened credit expo-sure. Many financial institutions continue to be overly dependent on wholesale financing, with sizable asset-liability mismatches and elevated liquidity and credit risks. Recent turbulence in money markets illustrates the vulnerabilities that remain in China’s increasingly large, opaque, and interconnected system. \\nEuropean Banking Systems Must Address \\nStructural Challenges\\nConsiderable progress has been made in the \\nEuropean banking sector over the past few years, and \\noptimism about a cyclical upturn in advanced econo-mies has helped boost European banks’ equity prices. However, as assessed in the October 2016 GFSR, a cyclical recovery will likely be insufficient on its own to restore the profitability of persistently weak banks. Although many banks face profitability challenges, this is particularly true for domestic banks, which are most exposed to their home economies: almost three-quar-ters of these banks had weak returns in 2016 (defined as return on equity of less than 8 percent). This report examines the system-wide structural features that are compounding profitability challenges. One structural challenge is overbanking, which varies by nature and degree from country to country. Some examples include banking systems with assets that are large rela-tive to the economy, with a long weak tail of banks, or with too many banks with a regional focus or a narrow mandate. These features can result in limited lending opportunities or a high number of branches relative to the assets in the banking system, adding to costs and reducing operational efficiencies. Although measures are being taken to address profitability concerns, more progress needs to be made in reducing overbanking in the countries with the biggest challenges. \\nSystem-wide headwinds are a problem not only \\nwithin countries but can also affect the profitability of large, systemically important banks in Europe. These institutions find it difficult to keep up with their global competitors, and in some cases this may be partly due to profitability problems in their home countries. Until these structural impediments are addressed, a simple restructuring of their business models is unlikely to yield sufficient profitability. Left unresolved, a combi-nation of weak profits, lack of access to private capital, and large bad debt burdens impedes recovery and could reignite systemic risks. \\nIt Is Crucial to Get the Policy Mix Right \\nSecuring and building on improvements in stabil-\\nity and market expectations will require concerted and careful efforts by policymakers at the national and global levels. Policymakers should adjust the policy mix to deliver a stronger path for long-term and inclu-sive growth while avoiding politically expedient but ultimately counterproductive inward-looking policies. In the United States, policymakers should vigilantly monitor increased leverage and deteriorating credit quality. Regulators should preemptively address exces-sive financial risk taking. Prudential and supervisory actions should be taken if policy stimulus leads to an increase in debt-financed investment and rising corpo-rate vulnerabilities. Tax reforms that reduce incentives for debt financing could help attenuate risks of a fur-ther buildup in leverage, and possibly even encourage firms to lower existing tax-advantaged leverage.\\nIn Europe, further actions should be taken to \\naddress bank profitability and legacy challenges. Banks have the primary responsibility for developing sustain-able earnings by tackling business model problems through consolidation, branch rationalization, and investment in technology to increase medium-term efficiency.

In Europe, political tensions combined with a lack of progress on structural challenges in banking systems and high debt levels could reignite financial stability concerns. The potential for a broad rollback of financial regulations—or a loss of global coopera-tion—could undermine hard-won gains in financial stability. So far, markets have taken a relatively benign view of these downside risks, suggesting the potential for a swift repricing of risks in the event of policy disappointment.\\nAre U.S. Companies Strong Enough to \\nAccelerate the Expansion Safely?\\nPolicy proposals under discussion by the new U.S. \\nadministration in the areas of tax reform and deregu-\\nlation could have a significant impact on the corporate sector.

The sectors that have invested the most have the highest leverage, and financing additional investment with debt will increase their vulnerabilities. Under a scenario of rising global risk premiums, higher leverage could have negative stability consequences. In such a scenario, the assets of firms with particularly low debt service capacity could rise to nearly $4 trillion, or almost a quarter of corporate assets considered.\\nEmerging Market Economies Face Trying Times \\nin Global Markets \\nEmerging market economies have continued to \\nenhance their resilience by lowering corporate leverage \\nand reducing external vulnerabilities.

China’s bank assets are now more than triple its GDP , and other nonbank financial institutions also have heightened credit expo-sure. Many financial institutions continue to be overly dependent on wholesale financing, with sizable asset-liability mismatches and elevated liquidity and credit risks. Recent turbulence in money markets illustrates the vulnerabilities that remain in China’s increasingly large, opaque, and interconnected system. \\nEuropean Banking Systems Must Address \\nStructural Challenges\\nConsiderable progress has been made in the \\nEuropean banking sector over the past few years, and \\noptimism about a cyclical upturn in advanced econo-mies has helped boost European banks’ equity prices. However, as assessed in the October 2016 GFSR, a cyclical recovery will likely be insufficient on its own to restore the profitability of persistently weak banks. Although many banks face profitability challenges, this is particularly true for domestic banks, which are most exposed to their home economies: almost three-quar-ters of these banks had weak returns in 2016 (defined as return on equity of less than 8 percent). This report examines the system-wide structural features that are compounding profitability challenges. One structural challenge is overbanking, which varies by nature and degree from country to country. Some examples include banking systems with assets that are large rela-tive to the economy, with a long weak tail of banks, or with too many banks with a regional focus or a narrow mandate. These features can result in limited lending opportunities or a high number of branches relative to the assets in the banking system, adding to costs and reducing operational efficiencies. Although measures are being taken to address profitability concerns, more progress needs to be made in reducing overbanking in the countries with the biggest challenges. \\nSystem-wide headwinds are a problem not only \\nwithin countries but can also affect the profitability of large, systemically important banks in Europe. These institutions find it difficult to keep up with their global competitors, and in some cases this may be partly due to profitability problems in their home countries. Until these structural impediments are addressed, a simple restructuring of their business models is unlikely to yield sufficient profitability. Left unresolved, a combi-nation of weak profits, lack of access to private capital, and large bad debt burdens impedes recovery and could reignite systemic risks. \\nIt Is Crucial to Get the Policy Mix Right \\nSecuring and building on improvements in stabil-\\nity and market expectations will require concerted and careful efforts by policymakers at the national and global levels. Policymakers should adjust the policy mix to deliver a stronger path for long-term and inclu-sive growth while avoiding politically expedient but ultimately counterproductive inward-looking policies. In the United States, policymakers should vigilantly monitor increased leverage and deteriorating credit quality. Regulators should preemptively address exces-sive financial risk taking. Prudential and supervisory actions should be taken if policy stimulus leads to an increase in debt-financed investment and rising corpo-rate vulnerabilities. Tax reforms that reduce incentives for debt financing could help attenuate risks of a fur-ther buildup in leverage, and possibly even encourage firms to lower existing tax-advantaged leverage.\\nIn Europe, further actions should be taken to \\naddress bank profitability and legacy challenges. Banks have the primary responsibility for developing sustain-able earnings by tackling business model problems through consolidation, branch rationalization, and investment in technology to increase medium-term efficiency.

Regulators should then take action to resolve unviable institutions to remove excess capacity. Authorities should also focus on removing system-wide impediments to profitability, including addressing nonperforming loans and developing frameworks that accelerate recovery.\\nEmerging market economies should address \\ndomestic vulnerabilities to enhance their resilience to external shocks. They should seek to preserve financial stability by taking further steps to strengthen supervi-sion and bank governance while maintaining a robust macroprudential toolkit. Bank regulators should closely monitor vulnerabilities in countries with wide net foreign-currency positions or foreign-currency matu-rity gaps. Policymakers should focus on strengthening the health of corporates and the banking system by proactively monitoring and reducing vulnerabilities and improving restructuring mechanisms. In China, although the authorities have recognized the urgent need to deleverage the financial system and have undertaken substantive corrective measures, supervi-sory attention should concentrate on banks’ emerg-ing risks, especially fast asset growth among smaller banks, increasing reliance on wholesale funding, and risks from interconnections between shadow products and interbank markets. But staving off further bouts of market instability—and ultimately, macro instabil-ity—will require measures to address the policy tension between maintaining a high level of growth and the need for deleveraging.\\n The postcrisis reform agenda has strengthened over-\\nsight of the financial system, raised capital and liquid-ity buffers of individual institutions, and improved cooperation among regulators. Caution is needed when considering any future regulatory rollback. While regu-lation is never costless, neither is its removal; weaken-ing regulatory standards comes at the cost of higher financial stability risks. Decisions to opt out of mutu-ally established regulations in an uncoordinated or uni-lateral manner could result in financial fragmentation and could threaten to reignite a race to the bottom in regulatory standards. Completing the regulatory reform agenda is vital to ensure that weaknesses are addressed and to reduce uncertainty. Although there is scope to consider the impact and unintended consequences of reforms, such a review should not unravel the broad improvements achieved in buttressing the resilience of the global financial system.\\nThis report also includes two thematic chapters \\nanalyzing the long-term implications of low growth and low interest rates for financial intermediation, and the ability of country authorities to influence domestic financial conditions in a financially integrated world.\\nA Long Period of Low Growth and Low \\nInterest Rates Would Challenge Financial Intermediation\\n Advanced economies have experienced a pro-\\nlonged episode of low interest rates and low growth \\nsince the global financial crisis. From a longer-term perspective, real interest rates have been on a steady decline over the past three decades. Despite recent signs of an increase in longer-term yields, particularly in the United States, Japan’s experience suggests that an imminent and permanent exit from low rates is not necessarily guaranteed, especially in view of the prevalence of slow-moving structural factors, such as demographic aging in many advanced economies. Chapter 2 analyzes the potential long-term impact of a scenario of sustained low growth and low real and nominal rates for the business models of banks, insur-ers, and pension funds and for the products offered by the financial sector. It finds that yield curves would likely flatten, lowering bank earnings—particularly of smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified institu-tions—and presenting long-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pension funds. If bank deposit rates cannot drop (significantly) below zero, bank profits would be squeezed even further. Smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified banks would be hurt most. As banks reach for yield, new financial stability challenges would arise in their home and host markets.\\nMore generally, a “low-for-long” interest rate envi-\\nronment, driven by population aging, rising longevity, and stagnation in productivity, could fundamentally change the nature of financial intermediation. For example, credit demand would likely be lower in this scenario, whereas household demand for transaction services would likely rise. Consequently, bank busi-ness models in advanced economies may evolve toward fees-based and utility banking services. Demographic   International Monetary Fund | April 2017 ixFinancial Stability Has Improved\\nFinancial stability has continued to improve since \\nthe October 2016 Global Financial Stability Report \\n(GFSR). Economic activity has gained momentum, \\nas outlined in the April 2017 World Economic Out-\\nlook (WEO), amid broadly accommodative monetary and financial conditions, spurring hopes for reflation. Longer-term interest rates have risen, helping to boost earnings of banks and insurance companies. Gains in many asset prices reflect a more optimistic outlook. Equity markets in the United States hit record highs in March on investors’ hopes for tax reform, infra-structure spending, and regulatory rollbacks. Markets outside the United States have also risen steadily over the past six months, driven in part by stronger growth expectations and higher commodity prices. At the same time, risk premiums and volatility have declined. \\nHow strong is the case for such optimism? To \\nrealize stronger growth and sustain the improve-ments in financial conditions, policymakers will need to implement the right mix of policies, including to (1) invigorate economic risk taking, especially in the United States, through policies that boost potential output, increase corporate investment, and avoid rais-ing financial stability risks; (2) address domestic and external imbalances to enhance resilience in emerging market economies; and (3) respond more proactively to long-standing structural issues in European banking systems.\\nPolicy Uncertainty Is a Key Downside Risk\\nNew threats to financial stability are emerging \\nfrom elevated political and policy uncertainty around the globe. In the United States, if the anticipated tax reforms and deregulation deliver paths for growth and debt that are less benign than expected, risk premi-ums and volatility could rise sharply, undermining financial stability.

Although greater financial integration can complicate the management of domes-tic financial conditions, it need not result in a loss of control. The chapter develops financial conditions indices that make it possible to compare a large set of advanced and emerging market economies. It finds that global financial conditions account for 20 to 40 percent of the variation in countries’ domestic financial condi-tions, with notable differences among economies. The importance of this global factor does not, however, seem to have increased much over the past two decades. \\nDespite the significant role of global financial \\nshocks, countries seem to be able to influence their own financial conditions to achieve domestic objec-tives—specifically, through monetary policy. But because domestic financial conditions react strongly and rapidly to global financial shocks, countries may find it difficult to implement timely policy responses. Emerging market economies, which are more sensi-tive to global financial conditions, should prepare for tighter external financial conditions. Governments can promote domestic financial deepening to enhance resil-ience to global financial shocks. In particular, develop-\\ning a local investor base, as well as fostering greater equity- and bond-market depth and liquidity, can help dampen the impact of such shocks. '],\n",

In\\nparticular, given the risk of corrections incredit derivative and CDO markets, regulatorsmust ensure that financial institutions main-tain robust counterparty risk managementpractices, not least to contain the spillovereffect of market corrections should theyoccur. Directors also stressed the importanceof disclosure and transparency to enhancethe flow of information, of the Standards andCodes work to help improve regulatoryframeworks, and of improving basic financialeducation especially among individualinvestors.

For the medium term, the risk ofgrowing global imbalances has to be addressedby a cooperative effort by the major coun-tries, with each adopting policies appropriateto its circumstances.\\nAspects of Global Asset Allocation\\nDirectors welcomed the work undertaken\\nby staff on global asset allocation and theincreasing role of institutional investors infinancial markets. They noted that a betterunderstanding of the investment patterns ofpension funds, insurance companies, mutualfunds, and, increasingly, hedge funds wouldhelp anticipate the potential for abruptchanges in capital flows across borders andasset classes, with direct relevance to financialstability and to policymakers.\\nDirectors considered the diversity of proce-\\ndures followed by various institutionalinvestors when allocating assets, reflectingtheir different time horizons, liability struc-tures, and “cultural backgrounds,” as well asexternal influences, such as accounting andfinancial reporting standards, tax rules, ratingagencies, and the availability of financialinstruments needed for adequate risk manage-ment. In this context, most Directors agreedthat the increasing dominance of strategic\\nasset allocations driven more by long-termeconomic fundamentals, including risk man-agement objectives, was a positive develop-ment, as it helps reduce the volatility and“noise” in financial markets, and makes someasset classes, such as emerging market debt,less prone to boom and bust cycles. In particu-lar, the continued growth of institutions withlong-term liabilities, such as pension funds,brings benefits from the point of view offinancial stability. Some Directors, however,noted that shifts in asset allocations by suchinstitutions might unsettle emerging marketswith relatively shallow financial markets, oramplify long swings and hinder market pricediscovery.\\nDirectors noted the sustained decline in\\n“home bias” on the part of institutionalinvestors throughout mature economies overthe past 15 years, particularly with regard toequity holdings. Directors agreed that majorfactors cited in the shift toward more interna-tionalized portfolios included less strict invest-ment restrictions, reduced information costs,and the spread of modern portfolio manage-ment practices. By raising average returnswhile reducing portfolio volatility, these devel-opments have bolstered financial stability.However, Directors noted that the decline inhome bias has also increased cross-border cap-ital flows and has probably led to greatercross-border correlations among asset mar-kets. Accordingly, Directors underscored thatFund surveillance has taken on even greaterimportance in a world in which institutionalportfolios have become increasingly interna-tional.

They recog-nized the importance of international efforts\\nANNEX SUMMING UP BY THE CHAIRMAN\\n150SUMMING UP BY THE CHAIRMAN\\n151to improve accounting principles in order to\\nenhance the comparability and transparencyof accounts and to strengthen market disci-pline. However, views differed on the impactof changes in accounting principles on finan-cial market stability. A number of Directorsagreed that accounting and financial report-ing standards may influence market behaviorand asset allocations by key institutionalinvestors, including by potentially encourag-ing long-term investors to adopt short-termtime horizons, or by reducing the diversity ofmarket behaviors across institutional investorcategories, particularly as it relates to theirlong-term, stable investment behavior. TheseDirectors encouraged ongoing internationalefforts to preserve both the measurement ben-efits of using market or fair values, whereverpossible, and secular gains in financial stabil-ity. A number of other Directors suggestedthat, while some issues exist as to fair valua-tion of assets and liabilities with thin markets,fair value accounting would strengthen trans-parency in financial markets, and would notlead to a shift to short-run strategies by majorinstitutional investors.\\nCorporate Bond Markets in Emerging\\nMarket Countries\\nDirectors welcomed the detailed study on\\ncorporate bond markets in emerging marketcountries. They observed that the achievementof macroeconomic stability by a number ofemerging market countries suggests that thetime may be right to press ahead with meas-ures that contribute to the development ofcorporate bond markets. Directors called forcontinued efforts by emerging markets to facil-itate the growth of institutional investors, andnoted that medium- and small-sized corpora-tions should adopt high standards of trans-parency and corporate governance to facilitatemarket access. Directors stressed that for theeffective functioning of securities markets, the\\nauthorities should adopt a regulatory frame-work that ensures investor protection and mar-ket integrity and contains systemic risks.\\nDirectors noted that emerging market\\ncountries should take measures that reducethe approval time and cost of issuance, includ-ing costs associated with discriminatory taxa-tion. Directors stressed the importance of awell-developed secondary market in improv-ing price discovery and liquidity while at thesame time acknowledging that only a fewindustrial countries were able to achieve thisgoal. Directors also noted the complementaryrole of the development of a governmentbond market, and that regional cooperationmay help promote the development of bondmarkets for countries that lack the minimumefficient scale needed for a deep and liquidbond market.\\nDirectors stressed the role of corporate\\nbond markets as an alternative funding sourcefor corporations, noting that such marketscould act as a buffer in the face of suddeninterruptions in bank credit or internationalcapital flows. However, several Directors cau-tioned against too rapid a growth of corporatebond markets in countries that lack the sup-porting financial infrastructure. In particular,the rapid growth in assets under managementof institutional investors combined with exces-sive concentration in a few market partici-pants could fuel asset price bubbles and causefinancial market instability. Directors encour-aged countries to take measures to preventexcessive concentration as well as to improverisk management practices and underscoredthe need for a balanced development of therequired institutions, intermediaries, and mar-ket microstructure to reduce risks.\\nDirectors offered several suggestions to take\\nthe GFSR to the next level of developmentafter three years of publication, which staffwill consider carefully going forward.'],\n",

They also welcomedongoing improvements in the fundamentalsof many emerging market countries. Prospectsfor continued financial stability are under-pinned by the still favorable outlook for theworld economy, and by the growing sophisti-cation in financial markets that has helpedspread risk. Nonetheless, Directors noted thatcurrently low long-term interest rates andcredit spreads could mask underlying vulnera-bilities and pose risks of market reversals,especially for less credit-worthy sovereigns andcorporations. While these risks are generallyexpected to be manageable given the strengthof financial institutions, Directors stressed theneed for continued vigilant monitoring andtimely policy measures.\\nGlobal Financial Market Surveillance\\nDirectors noted that markets have remained\\norderly through the ongoing interest ratetightening cycle in mature markets, facilitatedby the increasingly transparent communica-tion strategies of major central banks. Stillabundant global liquidity and improvingcredit quality have kept mature market bondyields and financial market volatility low.Other factors that have contributed to rela-tively low long-term bond yields includeexpectations that inflation will remain undercontrol, low corporate demand for net credit,\\nand growing demand for long-term bonds bypension funds and life insurance companies.More generally, low short-term interest rateshave encouraged investors to use leverage andmove out along the risk spectrum in theirquest for yield, buoying asset valuations andcompressing credit spreads.\\nDirectors noted that the corporate balance\\nsheet improvements in mature markets andthe quest for yield have encouraged investorsto increase their exposure to credit risk. Thishas contributed to falling corporate bondspreads, and possibly to reduced investor dis-crimination. Directors noted the growth ofcredit derivatives markets, which facilitate thetrading and hedging of credit risks. At thesame time, many Directors acknowledged thatthe derivatives markets’ expansion may exposesome investors to the possibility of leveragedlosses, which could be amplified by potentialliquidity problems. Furthermore, risk manage-ment models designed to deal with these newand more complex financial instruments mayhave yet to be put to a significant live test.Several Directors also called for increased dis-closure and continued monitoring of hedge\\nfund activities. Directors appreciated theGFSR’s continued attention to developments\\nin energy markets, and supported its call formore timely and reliable data on globaldemand and supply conditions.\\nDirectors observed that, along with improve-\\nments in many emerging market countries’fundamentals, abundant liquidity and questfor yield have been driving factors in recentdevelopments in emerging financial markets.\\n140\\nANNEX SUMMING UP BY THE ACTING CHAIR\\nThe following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive\\nBoard’s discussion of the Global Financial Stability Report on March 18, 2005 .

Directors reiterated, in this context,that a strong and sustained cooperativeeffort—aimed at ensuring a smooth adjust-ment of global imbalances over the mediumterm—will remain a key policy priority for theinternational community in the periodahead.\\nDirectors welcomed the improved external\\nfinancing environment for emerging marketborrowers. They noted that the improvedcredit quality of many emerging market bor-rowers and low interest rates in the majorfinancial centers contributed to the impressivecompression of spreads on emerging marketbonds last year. Directors commended thesteps taken by many emerging markets in thecurrent favorable market environment tomeet a substantial part of their borrowingneeds, improve their debt structures, andextend maturities. The correction of thedownward exchange rate over-shooting thatoccurred in 2003 in many Latin Americaneconomies should further help enhance debtsustainability in these countries. Directors alsowelcomed the trend toward making the inclu-sion of collective action clauses (CACs) in sov-ereign bond issues an industry standard.Notwithstanding this encouraging aggregateperformance, Directors noted that somecountries appear to have relaxed their fiscaland structural reform efforts. Unless they taketimely corrective action, these countries face aheightened risk of exposing their underlyingvulnerabilities in the event of a turnaround inthe current favorable external financingenvironment.\\nDirectors welcomed the continued strength-\\nening of the balance sheets of the household,corporate, and bank sectors over the course of2003, as corporate and household sectors con-tinued to build up liquidity and rising assetvalues strengthened net worth. Nevertheless,rising interest rates may increase the debtservice burden, particularly in a number ofEuropean countries where debt levels of thecorporate sector remain high. Directors notedthat the recent fall in long-term yields has\\nincreased refinancing activity in the U.S. mort-gage market and reopened the possibility ofhedging activity that might amplify yieldmovements. They welcomed, in this context,recent proposals to strengthen the regulationof the U.S. mortgage agencies and address theimplicit government guarantee.\\nDirectors emphasized that the relatively\\nbenign overall conditions in mature andemerging markets provide an advantageouswindow of opportunity to focus policy atten-tion on several key structural reforms tounderpin financial stability over the longerrun. In mature markets, recent scandals in themutual funds industry and some companies,such as Parmalat, have again underscored theneed to build on ongoing efforts to improvecorporate governance and strengthen marketfoundations. In particular, steps should betaken to strengthen scrutiny by investors andregulators of firms with complex ownershipand capital structures, as well as to enhancepublic oversight of auditing practices.Priorities on emerging countries’ agendagoing forward should include further reduc-tions in the level and vulnerability of publicdebt, development of local capital markets,and continued strong efforts to improve theclimate for foreign direct investment, whichhas remained at disappointingly low levels inspite of the general rebound in capital flows.\\nRisk Transfer and the Insurance Industry\\nDirectors welcomed the work being under-\\ntaken in the context of the current and forth-coming issues of the GFSR on the range ofregulatory and disclosure issues raised by thetransfer of risk from banking to nonbankinginstitutions in mature markets. A prominentexample is the rapid growth of the hedgefund sector where, despite closer counter-party and investor monitoring, there appearsto be a need for broader and more systematictransparency of exposures and practices.Directors noted that future staff work willSUMMING UP BY THE ACTING CHAIR\\n159 158\\nANNEX\\nExecutive Directors welcomed the con-\\ntinued improvement in internationalfinancial market conditions and thebrighter prospects for global financial\\nstability going forward.

Directorsnoted that the potential effects of higherinterest rates on emerging market economiesare being mitigated due to the progress thatmany of them have made in reducing vulnera-bilities, while stronger world growth will alsohelp offset the impact of higher interest rates.\\nDirectors also discussed the potential for\\nmarket instability arising from the large globalexternal imbalances, including the possibilitythat adverse developments in the currencymarkets might spill over into other asset mar-kets. They noted that the depreciation of theU.S. dollar against other major currencies hasso far been orderly. Most Directors consideredthat, in view of the substantial capital flowsthat the U.S. economy will continue to needto attract, the risk of a pronounced currencydepreciation—possibly resulting in higherU.S. dollar interest rates and a correction inSUMMING UP BY THE ACTING CHAIR\\nThe following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive\\nBoard’s dicussion of the Global Financial Stability Report on March 26, 2004.asset valuations—can nevertheless not be dis-\\nmissed. Directors reiterated, in this context,that a strong and sustained cooperativeeffort—aimed at ensuring a smooth adjust-ment of global imbalances over the mediumterm—will remain a key policy priority for theinternational community in the periodahead.\\nDirectors welcomed the improved external\\nfinancing environment for emerging marketborrowers. They noted that the improvedcredit quality of many emerging market bor-rowers and low interest rates in the majorfinancial centers contributed to the impressivecompression of spreads on emerging marketbonds last year. Directors commended thesteps taken by many emerging markets in thecurrent favorable market environment tomeet a substantial part of their borrowingneeds, improve their debt structures, andextend maturities. The correction of thedownward exchange rate over-shooting thatoccurred in 2003 in many Latin Americaneconomies should further help enhance debtsustainability in these countries. Directors alsowelcomed the trend toward making the inclu-sion of collective action clauses (CACs) in sov-ereign bond issues an industry standard.Notwithstanding this encouraging aggregateperformance, Directors noted that somecountries appear to have relaxed their fiscaland structural reform efforts. Unless they taketimely corrective action, these countries face aheightened risk of exposing their underlyingvulnerabilities in the event of a turnaround inthe current favorable external financingenvironment.\\nDirectors welcomed the continued strength-\\nening of the balance sheets of the household,corporate, and bank sectors over the course of2003, as corporate and household sectors con-tinued to build up liquidity and rising assetvalues strengthened net worth. Nevertheless,rising interest rates may increase the debtservice burden, particularly in a number ofEuropean countries where debt levels of thecorporate sector remain high. Directors notedthat the recent fall in long-term yields has\\nincreased refinancing activity in the U.S. mort-gage market and reopened the possibility ofhedging activity that might amplify yieldmovements. They welcomed, in this context,recent proposals to strengthen the regulationof the U.S. mortgage agencies and address theimplicit government guarantee.\\nDirectors emphasized that the relatively\\nbenign overall conditions in mature andemerging markets provide an advantageouswindow of opportunity to focus policy atten-tion on several key structural reforms tounderpin financial stability over the longerrun. In mature markets, recent scandals in themutual funds industry and some companies,such as Parmalat, have again underscored theneed to build on ongoing efforts to improvecorporate governance and strengthen marketfoundations. In particular, steps should betaken to strengthen scrutiny by investors andregulators of firms with complex ownershipand capital structures, as well as to enhancepublic oversight of auditing practices.Priorities on emerging countries’ agendagoing forward should include further reduc-tions in the level and vulnerability of publicdebt, development of local capital markets,and continued strong efforts to improve theclimate for foreign direct investment, whichhas remained at disappointingly low levels inspite of the general rebound in capital flows.\\nRisk Transfer and the Insurance Industry\\nDirectors welcomed the work being under-\\ntaken in the context of the current and forth-coming issues of the GFSR on the range ofregulatory and disclosure issues raised by thetransfer of risk from banking to nonbankinginstitutions in mature markets. A prominentexample is the rapid growth of the hedgefund sector where, despite closer counter-party and investor monitoring, there appearsto be a need for broader and more systematictransparency of exposures and practices.Directors noted that future staff work willSUMMING UP BY THE ACTING CHAIR\\n159focus on the hedge fund and pension fund\\nindustries.\\nDirectors welcomed the conclusion of the\\nstaff’s analysis that the reallocation of creditrisk to the insurance sector, together withimprovements in risk management in the sec-tor, appears to have contributed to enhancedoverall financial stability. Moreover, by allocat-ing a greater share of their portfolio to creditinstruments, many life insurers avail them-selves of a more predictable return. While theinvestment in credit instruments by insurersdeserves to be supported, Directors stressedthat this will need to go hand in hand withcontinued efforts to improve risk manage-ment and regulatory oversight of the sector.Areas for improvement highlighted byDirectors include: wider implementation ofrisk-based capital standards by regulators;enhancement of supervisory resources inmany mature market jurisdictions; increasedinformation sharing among supervisors; andstrengthened disclosure requirements.Directors welcomed the current debate oninternational accounting standards for insur-ers, and looked forward to the developmentof converging standards that provide an accu-rate reflection of insurance companies’ finan-cial position. To be adequate, disclosureshould be comprehensive, and include infor-mation on sensitivities and risks. While ratingagencies play a helpful role in disseminatinginformation on risks, Directors cautioned thatthey should not be relied upon as a substitutefor appropriate supervision.\\nInstitutional Investors in\\nEmerging Markets\\nDirectors welcomed the discussion of the\\ninstitutional investor base for claims on emerg-ing markets. They saw the development of astable investor base as a key element in reduc-ing the volatility of capital flows to emergingmarkets. While ongoing changes are con-tributing to a welcome broadening and diver-sification of the investor base, Directorsobserved that the decline in dedicated, rela-\\ntive to crossover, investors may also haveincreased the volatility of capital flows.Another source of potential volatility arisesfrom the impact that even small changes inthe portfolio positions of institutionalinvestors can have on emerging markets, giventhe large size of the assets under managementof these investors. Directors agreed that thefactors influencing the changing nature of theinvestor base, as well as their policy implica-tions—including for debt management poli-cies and practices in emerging markets—willrequire continued careful analysis. Theyemphasized the importance of adequate trans-parency and disclosure regarding both govern-ment policies and corporate developments,with investor relations programs being a par-ticularly useful instrument. In addition, thedevelopment of an efficient market infrastruc-ture within emerging markets will be helpfulin attracting institutional investors from bothmature and domestic markets.\\nDirectors also commented on the supervi-\\nsory and regulatory implications of theexpanding portfolios of nonbank institutionalinvestors in emerging markets, in particularthe rapid growth of pension funds. Theynoted that, in view of the growing imbalancebetween the assets under management ofthese funds and the available securities, closecoordination will be required betweenchanges in the regulatory framework, thedevelopment of local capital markets, and thegradual easing of limits on foreign invest-ments by pension funds to increase theiropportunities for portfolio diversification.Directors viewed the development of localsecurities markets as key to ensuring properrisk management by the insurance industry. Inview of the rapid growth and increasingsophistication of the activities of local institu-tional investors involved in both local andinternational markets, it will also be importantto persevere with strong efforts to enhancethe risk management skills of both investorsand regulators.ANNEX SUMMING UP BY THE ACTING CHAIR\\n160'],\n",

They noted thatANNEX CONCLUDING REMARKS BY THE CHAIRMAN\\n122POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES\\n123changes in the composition of the investor\\nbase for emerging market assets had increasedthe volatility of overall capital flows andexpressed concerns about the persistence ofboom-bust cycles for investment. Directorsrecommended that the staff continue to workon analyzing the sources of volatility in thesupply of funds to emerging markets.\\nDirectors pointed out that, while volatility\\nof capital flows seemed somewhat inevitable,sound economic policies and transparencycould help to make flows more stable. Therewas also much that emerging countries coulddo to “self-insure” themselves against theeffects of volatility, including through assetand liability management; adapting exchangerate arrangements to the degree of capitalaccount openness; strengthening domesticfinancial institutions; enhancing supervisionand regulation; and developing local securi-ties markets. Some Directors also felt that\\nself-insurance efforts might also be comple-mented by increased holdings of internationalreserves. Directors noted that developing effi-cient and stable local sources of finance hadbecome all the more relevant now that emerg-ing markets as a group had become netexporters of capital in recent years.\\nLooking ahead, Directors saw merit in\\nfuture staff work in the next GFSR on a num-ber of issues raised in the discussion, includ-ing on the factors behind and theimplications of the shift in the status ofemerging markets as a group to be netexporters of capital, including through theaccumulation of external reserves.

In the insur-\\nance sector, this will require intensified regu-latory efforts to encourage sounder asset riskmanagement practices, and, possibly, judi-cious adjustments to solvency standards toreduce the need to sell equities into a declin-ing market. In the case of defined-benefit pen-sion schemes, Directors highlighted the needto address the long-standing mismatchbetween pension fund assets and liabilities. Itwill also be important to adopt realistic actuar-ial assumptions for portfolio returns, whileavoiding precipitous regulatory changes thatcould trigger a self-reinforcing decline inequity markets. Directors considered it espe-cially important in the current environment toreassure investors that they face a level playingfield in the financial markets and that theyhave access to full and accurate informationon the health of publicly traded firms. Thecontinuation of ongoing efforts to improvecorporate governance, accounting, auditing,and investment banking practices thereforeremains a high priority.\\nDirectors observed that the “feast or\\nfamine” dynamic in emerging market financ-ing and persistent credit tiering underscorethe need for the consistent implementation ofsound macroeconomic policies. In addition,they encouraged continued measures todeepen local securities markets, which canhelp provide a buffer against changing globalfinancial conditions.\\nMeasures to Promote Local\\nSecurities Markets\\nDirectors welcomed the discussion in the\\nGFSR of key policy issues related to the rolethat local securities and derivatives marketscan play in strengthening the emerging mar-kets’ capacity to better weather global financialvolatility. They noted that these markets canprovide an additional and possibly more stable\\nsource of funding for domestic corporationsand the public sector, and stimulate domesticsavings by broadening the set of investmentopportunities. Among the core policies to pro-mote the development and ensure the smoothfunctioning of local securities markets,Directors highlighted measures to improvemarket infrastructure and transparency,strengthen corporate governance, develop liq-uid benchmarks, and promote a domesticinstitutional investor base. A few Directorsnoted the supportive role that foreign directinvestment in the financial sector can play inthis regard. Directors stressed that steps todevelop local securities markets need carefulsequencing, with the development of moneymarkets typically being a crucial first step indeveloping bond and derivatives markets. Inthis connection, a suggestion was also madethat country case studies could help guide thedevelopment of local securities markets.\\nDirectors cautioned against heavy resort to\\nbonds indexed to foreign currencies, whichcould increase vulnerability to external shocksand contribute to unstable debt structures.However, inflation-indexed bonds can be auseful instrument to deepen local bond mar-kets. While local derivatives markets can facili-tate the management of financial risk,Directors stressed that the development ofsuch markets needs to be based on a strongsupervisory and regulatory foundation.\\nAlthough local securities and derivatives\\nmarkets have grown substantially over the lastyears, Directors observed that they have notyet developed enough to provide full insur-ance against the closure of banking or inter-national markets, which in many cases mayremain a remote prospect. Directors sup-ported continued efforts to develop thesemarkets given their potential to improveemerging markets’ resilience.MEASURES TO PROMOTE LOCAL SECURITIES MARKETS\"],\n",

They noted the significant improvementin the macroeconomic performance of manyemerging market countries since the Asiancrisis. Most countries have adopted more flexi-ble exchange rate regimes, gained credibilityin managing inflation, strengthened eco-nomic, fiscal, and current account perform-ance, and accumulated significant foreignexchange reserves. These developments havecontributed to significant rating upgrades andimproved returns on emerging market assetclasses. Directors recognized that manyemerging market sovereigns have also usedthe current favorable global environment toANNEX SUMMING UP BY THE CHAIRMAN\\n134 132\\nSUMMING UP BY THE CHAIRMAN \\nAssessment of Financial Stability and\\nPolicy Implications\\nDirectors welcomed the continued resilience\\nof the global financial system, which has beensupported by solid global growth, low infla-tion, abundant liquidity, and flat yield curves.They considered that financial conditions willlikely remain benign in the most likely sce-nario of continued growth, contained infla-tion, and stable inflationary expectations. Atthe same time, Directors noted that the globalfinancial system faces a number of challenges,in particular rising interest rates and a turn inthe credit cycle for both the corporate andhousehold sectors. Given the strengthenedresilience of the financial system, mostDirectors considered that financial marketsshould be able to deal quite well with theenvisaged cyclical risks. A number of Directors,however, cautioned that medium-term risks tofinancial stability may have increased some-what in the past six months, given the growingglobal imbalances, the higher debt levels inthe household sector, and possible under-pricing of risk by investors in certain assetclasses. Directors urged national authorities tounderpin the strength and resilience of thefinancial system by pursuing macroeconomicpolicies that aim for solid and well-balancedgrowth, while strengthening the effectivenessof supervisory and regulatory oversight.\\nDirectors noted that the turn in the corpo-\\nrate credit cycle increases the chances for idio-syncratic risks leading to a widening of creditspreads for specific firms. They agreed, how-ever, that overall corporate sector balancesheets remain healthy, and moderate changesin the broad corporate spreads should enable\\nself-correcting forces to operate. SeveralDirectors suggested that the potential implica-tions for financial stability of the recent surgein leveraged buyouts warrant attention.\\nDirectors commented that housing and\\nmortgage markets also point to a turn in thecredit cycle, particularly in the United Stateswhere housing activity has moderated in recentmonths. In particular, higher interest ratescould raise the debt servicing burden of house-holds, already at high levels, worsening thecredit quality of mortgage markets and causinglosses to lending institutions. This risk, how-ever, is mitigated by the fact that the majorityof U.S. mortgages are at long-term fixed rates.Directors considered that, while the largeprime mortgage market still enjoys good creditquality, the main area of concern may lie in thesub-prime segment of the housing and mort-gage market, where marginal borrowers areexposed to the risks of rising interest rates anda stagnation or decline in house prices.\\nDirectors remarked that despite the rise in\\npolicy rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve,spreads for emerging market external bondsare at record low levels. They considered thatfundamental improvements have under-pinned this performance, including surplusesin the current account and strong capitalinflows, strengthened debt structures andlarge reserve cushions, accompanied by strongmacroeconomic policies and performance.Emerging markets will likely be tested by lessfavorable external conditions as liquidity con-ditions tighten further. Nevertheless, Directorsconcurred that emerging markets are likely toANNEX\\nThe following remarks by the Chairman were made at the conclusion of the Executive\\nBoard’s discussion of the Global Financial Stability Report on March 27, 2006.show continued resilience, and though\\nspreads could well widen in a correction, mar-kets should remain well anchored by funda-mentals and reduced vulnerabilities.\\nDirectors noted that a disorderly unwinding\\nof global imbalances remains a risk to finan-cial stability. So far, structural and cyclical fac-tors have combined to allow financial marketsto intermediate smoothly between surplus anddeficit countries. In a globalized financialmarket, the U.S. capital market offers interna-tional investors unparalleled depth, sophistica-tion, and flexibility, and investment in U.S.dollar assets remains attractive due to strongU.S. economic performance. Looking ahead,Directors noted that the prospect of a smoothadjustment in the pattern of accumulation ofU.S. dollar assets would be facilitated by thewillingness of key countries to take coopera-tive policy measures aimed at reducing globalimbalances over the medium term.\\nDirectors considered that, while cyclical\\nchanges could well expose weaker segmentsand pockets of financial markets, these areunlikely to pose systemic risks. Against thisbackdrop, many Directors urged regulators topursue a firm “no-bailout” policy, which wouldwork to contain risks of investor complacency.Broadly, regulators should place greaterreliance on the self-correcting forces of finan-cial markets, while focusing attention onensuring robust market infrastructures, partic-ularly for credit derivative markets. In particu-lar, Directors emphasized that financialregulators should require that rigorous riskmanagement practices are in place. Directorsalso urged regulators to provide guidance onthe content of business continuity plans toaddress possible vulnerabilities related toevent risks, such as an avian flu pandemic.\\nThe Influence of Credit Derivative\\nand Structured Credit Markets onFinancial Stability\\nDirectors noted that the rapid growth of\\ncredit derivative and structured credit mar-kets in recent years, particularly among more\\ncomplex products, has facilitated the disper-sion of credit risk by banks to a broader andmore diverse group of investors. They con-curred that credit risk dispersion has helpedto make the banking and overall financial sys-tem more resilient and stable. However,Directors observed that these markets havegrown rapidly in a relatively benign environ-ment, and market liquidity and certainaspects of the market infrastructure have notbeen fully tested by a severe or prolongedcredit downturn. Directors also viewed thepaucity of information to assess quantitativelythe degree of risk reduction among banksand to monitor effectively the destination ofrisks as a major challenge for policymakersand supervisors.\\nDirectors noted that credit derivative and\\nstructured credit markets present new chal-lenges and vulnerabilities that need to beunderstood and carefully monitored. In par-ticular, they stressed that market liquidity—including secondary market liquidity—is animportant ingredient for financial stability.Policymakers should encourage the participa-tion of an increasingly diversified investorbase, with different investment and tradingstrategies, as a key element of more liquid androbust markets.

In particular, thelarge current account surpluses and reservesbuildup of emerging market countries as agroup, including most of the systemicallyimportant countries, should reduce the needfor external borrowing and provide a cushionagainst any deterioration in external financingconditions. Directors also noted that the com-position of the emerging market investor baseis becoming more diverse, with the increasedpresence of strategic and long-term investorsenhancing the prospect of greater stability inthe emerging market sovereign asset class. Atthe same time, Directors cautioned that a sharprise in global interest rates could negativelyimpact emerging market countries.Notwithstanding the overall positive outlook\\nfor emerging market countries as a group,Directors cautioned that vulnerabilitiesremain for several emerging market countries,especially those with weaker fiscal positions,high debt and debt service burdens, large cur-rent account deficits, or heavy dependence ona few key commodities.

They stressed that sound macro-economic policies and continued pursuit ofstructural reforms will be essential to reducevulnerabilities.

       " [' International Monetary Fund | October 2016 ixShort-Term Risks Have Abated\\nShort-term risks to global financial stability have \\nabated since the April 2016 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR). Commodity prices have risen from \\ntheir lows earlier in the year, and ongoing adjustments in emerging markets have supported a recovery in capital flows. Immediate concerns over a slowdown in China have eased on the back of policy measures to shore up growth.\\nIn advanced economies, weaker growth was miti-\\ngated by the prospect of further monetary accommo-dation, which supported asset prices and spurred some recovery in risk appetites. The shock of Brexit—the June 2016 U.K. referendum result in favor of leav-ing the European Union—initially roiled markets. Markets have subsequently adjusted smoothly to concerns about downside risks to the U.K. economy and potential spillovers. \\nMedium-Term Risks Have Risen\\nDespite lower short-term risks, medium-term risks \\nare building. The continued slowdown in global growth has prompted financial markets to expect an extended period of low inflation and low interest rates and an even longer delay in normalizing monetary policy. The political climate is unsettled in many countries. A lack of income growth and a rise in inequality have opened the door for populist, inward-looking policies. These developments make it even harder to tackle legacy prob-lems, further expose economies and markets to shocks, and raise the risk of a gradual slide into economic and financial stagnation. In such a state, financial institu-tions struggle to sustain healthy balance sheets, which weakens economic growth and financial stability. \\nFinancial institutions in advanced economies face a \\nnumber of cyclical and structural challenges and need to adapt to this new era of low growth and low interest rates, as well as to an evolving market and regulatory environment. These are significant challenges that affect large parts of the financial system, and if unaddressed could undermine financial soundness. • Weak profitability could erode banks’ buffers over time and undermine their ability to support growth. This report finds that a cyclical recovery will not resolve the problem of low profitability. Over 25\\xa0percent of banks in advanced economies (about $11.7 trillion in assets) would remain weak and face significant structural challenges. More deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for European banks. Japanese banks also face significant business model challenges. These banks are expanding abroad to offset thin margins and weak domestic demand, but this exposes them to greater dollar funding risks. A disruption of dol-lar funding sources could force Japanese banks to curtail their offshore lending and investment.\\n• The solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates. Low interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from aging populations and low or volatile asset returns. Heightened concern over these important long-term-saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.\\nEmerging markets are also adapting to an envi-\\nronment of lower global growth, lower commodity \\nprices, and reduced global trade. The current favorable external environment, including low interest rates and the global search for investment opportunities, presents an opportunity for overly indebted firms to restructure their balance sheets. Corporate leverage in many of these markets may be peaking, since firms have slashed investment in the wake of commodity price declines and slowing demand. \\nThe challenge for many emerging market econo-\\nmies is to achieve a smooth deleveraging of weakened corporate balance sheets.

A disorderly adjustment is still possible if global risk premiums rise and earnings fall. Such a scenario would exhaust bank capital buffers in some emerging markets.\\nContinued rapid credit growth in China and \\nexpanding shadow banking products pose mount-ing risks to financial stability. The rapidly growing financial system is becoming increasingly leveraged and interconnected, and a variety of innovative investment vehicles and products are adding to the complexity. As discussed in the April 2016 GFSR, corporate debt-at-risk remains high, and underlying risks from nonloan credit exposures add to these challenges.   \\nMore Potent and Coordinated Policies Needed \\nto Foster Stability\\nPolicymakers need a more potent and balanced \\npolicy mix to deliver a stronger path for growth and \\nfinancial stability. Financial markets have benefited from renewed risk appetite in the wake of unprec-edented central bank actions. Although monetary accommodation is still needed to support the recov-ery, a more comprehensive set of policies would ease mounting burdens on central banks. Some monetary policies, such as negative interest rates, are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, and the medium-term side effects of low rates are rising for banks and other financial institutions. There is an urgent need to implement fiscal and structural policies to bol-ster confidence and raise global growth, and deploy macro prudential policies to strengthen the founda-\\ntions of the global financial system. This could help to avoid slipping into a state of financial and eco-nomic stagnation. A financial stagnation and protec-tionist scenario could result in a loss of world output by about 3\\xa0percent through 2021. \\nA number of pressing global challenges must be \\naddressed to ensure that the global financial system can continue to support the recovery and sustain hard-won resilience. Progress on the following fronts—together with a more balanced set of macroeconomic poli-cies outlined in the October 2016 issues of the World \\nEconomic Outlook and the Fiscal Monitor—would help \\npromote a virtuous cycle between financial markets and the real economy. The resolution of debt over-hangs in an era of low nominal growth is also likely to require growth-friendly fiscal policies to support economic activity and create incentives for restructur-ing private debt, while facilitating the repair of banks’ balance sheets. \\nBanks must adjust to this new environment of \\nlow growth and low interest rates by reducing large stocks of legacy problem loans, and rationalizing bal-ance sheets and industry structures. This will require adjusting dated business models in order to maintain profitability, and adapting to new business realities and regulatory standards. In some cases, weak banks will have to exit and banking systems will have to shrink. This is important to ensure that the remaining banks have sufficient credit demand to foster a vibrant and healthy banking system that can grow and sustain its strengthened capital and liquidity buffers. Policymak-ers can help reduce uncertainty by completing the regulatory reform agenda, without significantly increas-ing overall capital requirements, while preserving the integrity of the capital framework. • In the euro area, excessive nonperforming loans and structural drags on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action. Reducing nonperform-ing loans and addressing capital deficiencies at weak banks is a priority. Reforms that speed up asset recovery and facilitate smoother insolvency procedures would bring large benefits. For the euro area as a whole, the net capital impact from the sale of nonperforming loans would swing from a loss of about €80 billion to a gain of about €60\\xa0billion with such reforms. Enhancing operational efficiency through rationalizing branch networks, together with an improved funding mix and cost, could improve banks’ overall expenses by about $40\\xa0billion. \\n• In Japan, intensified supervision is needed to ensure that banks maintain adequate profitability and healthy funding profiles to meet the demands of changing global regulatory standards.\\n• Regulatory uncertainty needs to be reduced and procyclical outcomes avoided. The Basel III capi-tal adequacy framework was a key plank of the postcrisis reform agenda and has led to enhanced resilience of banking systems following its phased-in implementation.

Actions are needed on three fronts: (1) managing the impact of corporate distress, through swift and transparent recognition of nonper-forming loans and strengthening insolvency frame-works; (2) boosting oversight and response capacity through reforms to macroprudential and supervisory frameworks; and (3) ensuring continued access to international financial services, including through strengthened regulatory and supervisory regimes that help lower risk perceptions, including those support-ing correspondent banking activity. \\nThe Chinese authorities’ latest reform efforts have \\nled to more balanced growth and a greater role for market forces, improving the resilience of the Chinese economy and financial system. Nonetheless, China’s corporate debt overhang and other growing financial sector vulnerabilities must be addressed promptly through a comprehensive approach to facilitate deleveraging and upgrade the supervisory framework. Curbing excessive credit growth, including in the form of riskier shadow credit products, and ensuring sound interbank funding structures would reduce the potential for system stress and spillovers. \\nGlobal institutions have a role to play in promoting \\ninclusive growth and encouraging an open dialogue on globalization. Most countries would reap macro-economic growth benefits from greater access by firms and individuals to banking services. Closing gender gaps in account usage and promoting diversity in the depositor base can have broader economic benefits while creating opportunities for the disadvantaged.  \\nMonetary Policy Impact Changing, but Not \\nWeakened by Growth in Nonbank Financing\\nA notable change in global financial markets in the \\npast decade has been the rise of nonbank financial inter-\\nmediaries such as asset managers, insurance companies, and pension funds. Although concerns have been voiced about a decline in the effectiveness of monetary policy given the growing role of nonbank financing, these fears appear to be unfounded. Indeed, Chapter 2 finds that, on average, monetary policy transmission seems to be stronger in economies with larger nonbank financial sectors. Nonbanks tend to contract their balance sheets even more than banks when monetary policy tightens—a behavior partly explained by the effect of monetary policy on risk taking. \\nLow interest rates have probably created the condi-\\ntions for more risk taking by both bank and nonbank financial intermediaries. However, the conjunction of weak bank balance sheets and stronger bank regulation could mean that nonbanks now play a more important role in the transmission of monetary policy because the risk-taking channel of monetary policy has gained importance and asset managers have assumed a greater role in financial intermediation. As a result, the effects of monetary policy changes on the real economy may become more rapid and marked. This suggests the need for greater vigilance by prudential and regulatory authorities and for central banks to continuously recali-brate the dosage and timing of monetary policy actions as their impact and the speed of their transmission change—particularly in an environment characterized by new challenges to financial stability.\\nGiven the growth of the nonbank financial sector, the \\ninformation contained in the balance sheets of nonbanks is potentially at least as useful as traditional measures of monetary aggregates. In this context, improving data collection on nonbanks is essential.   International Monetary Fund | October 2016 ixShort-Term Risks Have Abated\\nShort-term risks to global financial stability have \\nabated since the April 2016 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR). Commodity prices have risen from \\ntheir lows earlier in the year, and ongoing adjustments in emerging markets have supported a recovery in capital flows. Immediate concerns over a slowdown in China have eased on the back of policy measures to shore up growth.\\nIn advanced economies, weaker growth was miti-\\ngated by the prospect of further monetary accommo-dation, which supported asset prices and spurred some recovery in risk appetites. The shock of Brexit—the June 2016 U.K. referendum result in favor of leav-ing the European Union—initially roiled markets. Markets have subsequently adjusted smoothly to concerns about downside risks to the U.K. economy and potential spillovers. \\nMedium-Term Risks Have Risen\\nDespite lower short-term risks, medium-term risks \\nare building. The continued slowdown in global growth has prompted financial markets to expect an extended period of low inflation and low interest rates and an even longer delay in normalizing monetary policy. The political climate is unsettled in many countries. A lack of income growth and a rise in inequality have opened the door for populist, inward-looking policies. These developments make it even harder to tackle legacy prob-lems, further expose economies and markets to shocks, and raise the risk of a gradual slide into economic and financial stagnation. In such a state, financial institu-tions struggle to sustain healthy balance sheets, which weakens economic growth and financial stability. \\nFinancial institutions in advanced economies face a \\nnumber of cyclical and structural challenges and need to adapt to this new era of low growth and low interest rates, as well as to an evolving market and regulatory environment. These are significant challenges that affect large parts of the financial system, and if unaddressed could undermine financial soundness. • Weak profitability could erode banks’ buffers over time and undermine their ability to support growth. This report finds that a cyclical recovery will not resolve the problem of low profitability. Over 25\\xa0percent of banks in advanced economies (about $11.7 trillion in assets) would remain weak and face significant structural challenges. More deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for European banks. Japanese banks also face significant business model challenges. These banks are expanding abroad to offset thin margins and weak domestic demand, but this exposes them to greater dollar funding risks. A disruption of dol-lar funding sources could force Japanese banks to curtail their offshore lending and investment.\\n• The solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates. Low interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from aging populations and low or volatile asset returns. Heightened concern over these important long-term-saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.\\nEmerging markets are also adapting to an envi-\\nronment of lower global growth, lower commodity \\nprices, and reduced global trade. The current favorable external environment, including low interest rates and the global search for investment opportunities, presents an opportunity for overly indebted firms to restructure their balance sheets. Corporate leverage in many of these markets may be peaking, since firms have slashed investment in the wake of commodity price declines and slowing demand. \\nThe challenge for many emerging market econo-\\nmies is to achieve a smooth deleveraging of weakened corporate balance sheets. Approximately 11 percent of corporate debt (over $400 billion) is held by firms with weak repayment capacity. Indebtedness declines only gradually under our baseline scenario, as high \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYx International Monetary Fund | October 2016\\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: FOSTERING STABILITY IN A LOW-GROWTH, LOW-RATE ERAdebt levels and excess capacity make it difficult to grow \\nout of the problem, leaving them sensitive to down-side external or domestic developments. A disorderly adjustment is still possible if global risk premiums rise and earnings fall. Such a scenario would exhaust bank capital buffers in some emerging markets.\\nContinued rapid credit growth in China and \\nexpanding shadow banking products pose mount-ing risks to financial stability. The rapidly growing financial system is becoming increasingly leveraged and interconnected, and a variety of innovative investment vehicles and products are adding to the complexity. As discussed in the April 2016 GFSR, corporate debt-at-risk remains high, and underlying risks from nonloan credit exposures add to these challenges.   \\nMore Potent and Coordinated Policies Needed \\nto Foster Stability\\nPolicymakers need a more potent and balanced \\npolicy mix to deliver a stronger path for growth and \\nfinancial stability. Financial markets have benefited from renewed risk appetite in the wake of unprec-edented central bank actions. Although monetary accommodation is still needed to support the recov-ery, a more comprehensive set of policies would ease mounting burdens on central banks. Some monetary policies, such as negative interest rates, are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, and the medium-term side effects of low rates are rising for banks and other financial institutions. There is an urgent need to implement fiscal and structural policies to bol-ster confidence and raise global growth, and deploy macro prudential policies to strengthen the founda-\\ntions of the global financial system. This could help to avoid slipping into a state of financial and eco-nomic stagnation. A financial stagnation and protec-tionist scenario could result in a loss of world output by about 3\\xa0percent through 2021. \\nA number of pressing global challenges must be \\naddressed to ensure that the global financial system can continue to support the recovery and sustain hard-won resilience. Progress on the following fronts—together with a more balanced set of macroeconomic poli-cies outlined in the October 2016 issues of the World \\nEconomic Outlook and the Fiscal Monitor—would help \\npromote a virtuous cycle between financial markets and the real economy. The resolution of debt over-hangs in an era of low nominal growth is also likely to require growth-friendly fiscal policies to support economic activity and create incentives for restructur-ing private debt, while facilitating the repair of banks’ balance sheets. \\nBanks must adjust to this new environment of \\nlow growth and low interest rates by reducing large stocks of legacy problem loans, and rationalizing bal-ance sheets and industry structures. This will require adjusting dated business models in order to maintain profitability, and adapting to new business realities and regulatory standards. In some cases, weak banks will have to exit and banking systems will have to shrink. This is important to ensure that the remaining banks have sufficient credit demand to foster a vibrant and healthy banking system that can grow and sustain its strengthened capital and liquidity buffers. Policymak-ers can help reduce uncertainty by completing the regulatory reform agenda, without significantly increas-ing overall capital requirements, while preserving the integrity of the capital framework. • In the euro area, excessive nonperforming loans and structural drags on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action. Reducing nonperform-ing loans and addressing capital deficiencies at weak banks is a priority. Reforms that speed up asset recovery and facilitate smoother insolvency procedures would bring large benefits. For the euro area as a whole, the net capital impact from the sale of nonperforming loans would swing from a loss of about €80 billion to a gain of about €60\\xa0billion with such reforms. Enhancing operational efficiency through rationalizing branch networks, together with an improved funding mix and cost, could improve banks’ overall expenses by about $40\\xa0billion. \\n• In Japan, intensified supervision is needed to ensure that banks maintain adequate profitability and healthy funding profiles to meet the demands of changing global regulatory standards.\\n• Regulatory uncertainty needs to be reduced and procyclical outcomes avoided. The Basel III capi-tal adequacy framework was a key plank of the postcrisis reform agenda and has led to enhanced resilience of banking systems following its phased-in implementation. The Regulatory Consistency Assessment Program, launched to monitor con-sistent implementation across countries, revealed excessive risk weight variability across banks using internal models. Addressing this material variabil-exeCutIve su MM ary\\n International Monetary Fund | October 2016 xiity to ensure the credibility of the risk-weighted \\nframework and comparability of its outcomes is an integral part of the reform agenda. It is better to obtain agreement on a robust risk-weighted capital framework, even if the agreement takes more time, than to see the framework diluted or withdrawn to meet the challenging constraints of no further significant increase in overall capital requirements and the end-2016 deadline. Implementation may also have to be phased in over a longer period to avoid potentially procyclical consequences under the current circumstances. \\n• Shoring up life insurers and pension funds remains critical. Sustained low growth and low interest rates raise significant challenges for long-term investment and savings institutions such as life insurers and pension funds. Regulators and supervisors should act promptly to sustain the strength of insurance and pension fund balance sheets, including identify-ing medium-term insolvency risks and funding gaps, while enhancing the reform agenda to strengthen standards for internal models and capital frame-works and improve transparency.  \\nEmerging market economies should take advantage \\nof supportive external conditions to proactively moni-\\ntor and address corporate vulnerabilities, particu-larly those arising from excess leverage and foreign exchange exposures.

Chapter 3 finds that corporate governance and investor protection have generally improved in emerg-ing market economies over the past two decades. These improvements are visible both at the firm level and at the country level. Even so, there are important differ-ences across emerging market economies, and there is room for further improvement. \\nThe analysis shows that stronger corporate governance \\nand investor protection frameworks enhance the resil-ience of emerging market economies to global finan-\\ncial shocks—an issue of particular importance in the new phase the global financial system is entering. For example, equity price declines in the wake of Brexit were relatively larger in emerging market economies with lower corporate governance standards. Corporate gov-ernance improvements enhance stock market efficiency and foster deeper and more liquid capital markets, allowing them to absorb shocks better. Emerging market economies with better corporate governance generally also have more resilient corporate balance sheets. \\nPolicies to further bolster the rights of outside inves-\\ntors, especially minority shareholders; bring disclosure requirements fully in line with international best practice; and promote greater board independence are likely to yield financial stability benefits.'],\n",

Many emerging markets have increased their resilience to external shocks with increased exchange rate flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on FDI flows and domestic-currency external financing, and generally stronger policy frameworks. But balance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market com-panies and banks. These firms have become more susceptible to financial stress, economic downturn, and capital outflows. Deteriorating corporate health runs the risk of deepening the sovereign-corporate and the corporate-bank nexus in some key emerging markets. China in particular faces a delicate bal-ance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing financial vulnerabilities and moving toward a more market-based system—a challenging set of objectives. Recent market developments, including slumping commodity prices, China’s bursting equity and margin-lending bubble, falling emerging market equities, and pressure on exchange rates, underscore these challenges. \\n• Legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies—High public and private debt in advanced economies and remaining gaps in the euro area architecture need to be addressed to consolidate financial stabil-ity, and avoid political tensions and headwinds to confidence and growth. In the euro area, addressing remaining sovereign and banking vulnerabilities is still a challenge. \\n• Weak systemic market liquidity—This poses a chal-\\nlenge in adjusting to new equilibria in markets and the wider economy. Extraordinarily accommodative policies have contributed to a compression of risk pre-miums across a range of markets including sovereign bonds and corporate credit, as well as a compression of liquidity and equity risk premiums. While recent market developments have unwound some of this compression, risk premiums could still rise further. Now that the Federal Reserve looks set to begin the gradual process of tightening monetary policy, the global financial system faces an unprecedented adjust-ment as risk premiums “normalize” from historically low levels alongside rising policy rates and a modest cyclical recovery. Abnormal market conditions will need to adjust smoothly to the new environment. But there are risks from a rapid decompression, particu-larly given what appears to be more brittle market structures and market fragilities concentrated in credit intermediation channels, which could come to the fore as financial conditions normalize (see Chapter 2). Indeed, recent episodes of high market volatility and liquidity dislocations across advanced and emerging market asset classes highlight this challenge.\\nStrong policy actions are needed to ensure “successful normalization”\\nThe relatively weak baseline for both financial stabil-\\nity and the economic outlook leaves risks tilted to the downside. Thus, ensuring successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions and a smooth handover to higher growth requires further policy efforts to tackle pressing challenges. These should include the following: • Continued effort by the Federal Reserve to provide clear and consistent communication, enabling the smooth absorption of rising U.S. rates, which is essential for global financial health. \\n• In the euro area, more progress in strengthening the financial architecture of the common currency to bolster market and business confidence. Addressing the overhang of private debt and bank nonperform-ing loans in the euro area would support bank finance and corporate health, and boost investment. \\n• Rebalancing and gradual deleveraging in China, which will require great care and strong commit-ments to market-based reforms and further strength-ening of the financial system. \\n• More broadly, addressing both cyclical and structural challenges in emerging markets, which will be criti-cal to underpin improved prospects and resilience. Authorities in emerging markets should regularly monitor corporate foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions, and use micro- and macroprudential tools to discourage the buildup of excessive leverage and foreign indebtedness. \\n• Safeguarding against market illiquidity and strength-ening market structures, which are priorities, espe-cially in advanced economies’ markets. \\n• Ensuring the soundness and health of banks and the long-term savings complex (for example, insurers and pension funds), which is critical, as highlighted in the April 2015 GFSR.

Shocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sud-den drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes. Under these conditions, a significant—even if tempo-rary—mispricing of assets may ensue, with negative repercussions on financial stability (see Chapter 2).\\nIn such an adverse scenario, substantially tighter \\nfinancial conditions could stall the cyclical recovery and weaken confidence in medium-term growth prospects. Low nominal growth would put pressure on debt-laden sovereign and private balance sheets, raising credit risks. Emerging markets would face higher global risk premiums and substantial capital outflows, putting particular pressure on economies with domestic imbalances. Corporate default rates would rise, particularly in China, raising financial system strains, with implications for growth. These events would lead to a reappearance of risks on sover-eign balance sheets, especially in Europe’s vulnerable economies, and the emergence of an adverse feedback loop between corporate and sovereign risks in emerg-ing markets. As a result, aggregate global output could be as much as 2.4 percent lower by 2017, relative to the baseline. This implies lower but still positive global growth.'],\n",

This continuing high debt calls for an additional response to address the crisis legacies and unshackle economic potential. Gross corporate debt in France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain is expected to remain above or near 70 percent of GDP by 2020, and gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other major advanced economies. \\nAt the same time there is a clear upside risk to interest \\nrates in the United States.

Indeed, declines in structural liquidity in fixed-income markets in both the United States and other economies have amplified asset price responses to shocks, increasing potential spillovers. Technological change, increased regulation, and the shifting composition of market participants have altered the microstructure of fixed-income markets.

Lower commodity prices and lower inflationary pressures are benefiting many emerging market economies, provid-ing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. However, oil- and commodity-exporting countries and countries with high foreign indebtedness face more formidable risks. Although the stronger dollar can help improve competitiveness in emerging market economies in general, and lead to higher growth, the dramatic movements in commodity prices and in the exchange rates of many emerging market economies during the past six months have already had a significant impact on firms’ market valuations in these economies. Many companies borrowed heavily in international markets—substituting international borrowings in dollars for local currency borrowing from banks—potentially leading to balance sheet pressures. \\nIn turn, a retrenchment of overinvested industries, \\nreal estate sector adjustments, and  property price declines—especially in China—could spill over to emerging markets more broadly. The broader impact of a sudden deterioration in corporate health on banking system stability depends on credit exposures. In China, exposures to real estate (excluding mortgages) are almost 20 percent of GDP , and financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spill-overs, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. In 11 of the 21 emerging market banking systems analyzed in this report, more than half of the bank loan books consists of loans to firms, rendering them more exposed to corporate weakness, particularly in Nigeria, Peru, T urkey, and Ukraine.\\nIn a downside risk scenario, further rapid dollar \\nappreciation and an abrupt rise in U.S. interest rates, coupled with a rise in geopolitical risks, could put added pressure on emerging market currencies and asset markets.

Markets also appear complacent when it comes to geopolitical and politi-cal risks.

A key message is that additional policy measures—beyond monetary policies—are required to make a well-grounded exit from the crisis. Poli-cies must address crisis legacies and facilitate sustain-able economic risk taking while containing financial excesses across global markets. \\nTo maximize the impact of quantitative easing in \\nthe euro area, central bank actions must be comple-\\nmented with measures to restore balance sheet health in the private sector, unclog credit channels, enhance the soundness of nonbank institutions, and promote structural reforms. In particular, • Unclogging credit channels requires comprehensive actions to tackle the burden of nonperforming loans. Despite improving bank resilience in the wake of the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment and introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, asset quality continues to deteriorate, although at a slowing pace, with total nonperforming loans now standing at more than €900 billion. Banks should be encouraged to develop and use specialized internal and external capacity for handling the stock of nonperforming assets, actively manage their provisions, and write off their nonperforming assets. Further efforts are needed to improve the effectiveness of legal frame-works governing bankruptcy of companies and individuals. Without corrective policy actions, bank lending capacity could be limited to a meager 1 to 3 percent on average a year.\\n• The challenges facing life insurers should also be tackled promptly. Regulators need to reassess the via-bility of guarantee-based products and work to bring minimum return guarantees offered to policyholders in line with secular trends in policy rates. Prompt regulatory and supervisory actions are needed to mitigate damaging spillovers from potential difficul-ties of individual insurers. The introduction of a more harmonized safety net would further increase the industry’s resilience.\\n• Sources of funding need to be diversified away from banks and toward capital markets. Despite the surge in capital market borrowings, they represent only about 36 percent of the system. A deeper and broader capital market would improve access to finance, par-ticularly for smaller firms, and make financial markets more efficient. In the euro area, encouraging the use of capital markets requires harmonization of com-pany law, corporate governance, insolvency regimes, and taxation, in line with the latest Capital Markets Union proposal by the European Commission.\\nIn Japan the effectiveness of quantitative easing \\ndepends on the policies supporting it. Steadfast imple-\\nmentation of Abenomics’ second and third arrows (fiscal and structural reforms) is essential. If these reforms are incomplete, efforts to pull the economy out of deflation are less likely to succeed. The Bank of Japan should consider strengthening the portfolio rebalancing effects of its asset purchases by increasing the share of private assets in purchases and extending the program to longer-maturity government bonds, as necessary, to achieve its 2 percent inflation target. To further stimulate bank lending to the private sector, the authorities should expand special lending facili-ties; jumpstart the securitization market for small and medium enterprise credits and mortgages; and enhance risk capital provision, including by encouraging more asset-based lending and removing barriers to entry and exit for small and medium enterprises.\\nIn the United States, the impact of global market \\nforces requires appropriately balanced policies, includ-ing continued clear communication of monetary poli-cies. A smooth market adjustment will be more likely if there is extensive discussion and interpretation of key economic variables given that monetary policy is now data dependent. Yet market expectations can differ from the Federal Reserve’s guidance, leading to market tensions and raising market and liquidity risks.\\nIn the United States and other economies with sig-\\nnificant nonbank financial systems, addressing illiquidity and potential spillovers by strengthening market struc-tures will help enhance stability. As noted in Chapter 3, the asset management industry needs stronger oversight that combines better microprudential supervision of risks with the adoption of a macroprudential orientation. Policies should seek to address the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when redemptions must be met in times of stress. Policies can help to accom-plish this objective by reducing asset owners’ incentives to run (by aligning funds’ redemption terms with the   International Monetary Fund | April 2015 ixMacroeconomic shocks pose new challenges for global \\nmarkets \\nA wide range of positive and negative macroeconomic \\nand financial developments have occurred in the past six months.

Prompt regulatory and supervisory actions are needed to mitigate damaging spillovers from potential difficul-ties of individual insurers. The introduction of a more harmonized safety net would further increase the industry’s resilience.\\n• Sources of funding need to be diversified away from banks and toward capital markets. Despite the surge in capital market borrowings, they represent only about 36 percent of the system. A deeper and broader capital market would improve access to finance, par-ticularly for smaller firms, and make financial markets more efficient.

Steadfast imple-\\nmentation of Abenomics’ second and third arrows (fiscal and structural reforms) is essential. If these reforms are incomplete, efforts to pull the economy out of deflation are less likely to succeed. The Bank of Japan should consider strengthening the portfolio rebalancing effects of its asset purchases by increasing the share of private assets in purchases and extending the program to longer-maturity government bonds, as necessary, to achieve its 2 percent inflation target. To further stimulate bank lending to the private sector, the authorities should expand special lending facili-ties; jumpstart the securitization market for small and medium enterprise credits and mortgages; and enhance risk capital provision, including by encouraging more asset-based lending and removing barriers to entry and exit for small and medium enterprises.\\nIn the United States, the impact of global market \\nforces requires appropriately balanced policies, includ-ing continued clear communication of monetary poli-cies.

As noted in Chapter 3, the asset management industry needs stronger oversight that combines better microprudential supervision of risks with the adoption of a macroprudential orientation. Policies should seek to address the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when redemptions must be met in times of stress.

Market participants in government bond and foreign exchange markets should also have greater incentives to provide secondary market liquid-ity. Authorities should review current circuit breakers to enhance their functioning. Risk management and control should be reinforced: supervisors should provide coor-dinated guidance to trading firms, allowing them to set consistent and appropriate risk limits on individual retail investors. Regulators and monetary authorities should consider the correlation between asset classes when evalu-ating systemic risks in financial markets.\\nEmerging markets\\xa0should aim to cushion the \\nimpact of global headwinds and safeguard the resilience of their financial systems through enhanced surveillance of vulnerable sectors, particularly in the following areas:• In China, the overall priority must be to allow an orderly correction of excesses, curtailing the riskiest parts of shadow banking. At the same time, orderly deleveraging requires comprehensive policies that allow credit growth to slow gradually and, where necessary, the mechanisms to be provided for orderly  corporate debt restructuring, and the exit of nonvi-able firms. \\n• Across emerging markets more generally, the large portion of debt denominated in foreign currencies means that micro- and macroprudential measures have important roles to play in limiting the risks from shocks. Regulators need to conduct bank stress tests related to foreign currency and commodity price risks and more closely and regularly monitor corporate leverage and foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions.\\n• To ensure markets function properly, authorities need to prepare for lapses of liquidity in local cur-rency bond markets. Country authorities might potentially use cash balances when needed, or lower the supply of long-term debt to the market to help curtail bond spread increases. Bilateral and multilateral swap line agreements, by providing foreign currency funding in times of stress, can enhance confidence and help reduce excess volatil-ity in currency markets. Multilateral resources such as IMF facilities could also provide additional buffers.The international financial regulatory reform \\nagenda has strengthened regulatory frameworks, and is helping to make financial institutions and the global financial system more robust. Global standard setters and national regulators now need to provide further clarity about regulatory standards—and thus improve certainty for banks adapting their business models—by finalizing the calibration of recent requirements, including the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, and total loss-absorbing capital requirements. Promptly putting in place regulations to transform shadow banking into a stable source of market-based finance is also a must.\\nAt the same time, micro- and macroprudential \\npolicies for nonbanks should be strengthened. Exist-ing regulatory frameworks may need to be reassessed to enable the authorities to better understand the less closely regulated corners of the financial sector that could cause problems for the banking system and the broader economy, and act as needed to mitigate identi-fied vulnerabilities. \\nChanges in international banking models have \\nreduced risks in host financial systems\\nOn a more positive note, Chapter 2, which examines \\nchanges in international banking since the global finan-cial crisis, finds that these changes are likely to promote more stable bank lending in host countries. It also finds a need for more international cooperation for dealing with regional or global shocks to maximize the benefits of cross-border banking while mitigating risks. \\nInternational banks, especially those in Europe, \\nhave reduced their cross-border lending, while local loans by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks abroad have remained steady. Local and regional banks have stepped in to offset, at least partially, euro area banks’ reduction in exposure to some regions. As a result, intraregional linkages have deepened, in particular in Asia. Regulatory changes and weaknesses in bank balance sheets have contributed significantly in the past to the observed cutback in cross-border lending, whereas accommodative monetary policies may have slowed the cutback.\\nThe relative shift from cross-border lending to more \\nlocal lending by affiliates should improve the finan-cial stability of host countries. Cross-border lending flows are more sensitive to global shocks than are local lending and international portfolio flows. Cross-border lending also tends to amplify the effect of adverse   International Monetary Fund | April 2015 ixMacroeconomic shocks pose new challenges for global \\nmarkets \\nA wide range of positive and negative macroeconomic \\nand financial developments have occurred in the past six months. On a net basis, these developments have increased financial stability risks.\\nOn the positive side, as discussed in the April 2015 \\nWorld Economic Outlook, growth in 2015 is expected to be slightly higher than that of 2014, improving in advanced economies enough to offset slower growth in emerging market and developing economies. Sharply lower oil and commodity prices, coupled with lower interest rates from expanded monetary accommodation, are expected to support growth through 2016. Bold monetary policy actions have been taken in both the euro area and Japan to arrest and reverse disinflation-ary pressures. Quantitative easing provides a strong framework for addressing deflation risks, and some key transmission channels are already working. Spreads on credit have narrowed in the euro area, equity prices have surged, and the euro and yen have depreciated significantly, helping to raise inflation expectations. \\nAt the same time, the U.S. dollar has appreciated \\nsubstantially, reflecting diverging monetary policies. The dollar has strengthened more against major currencies during the past nine months than it has during any similar period since 1981. The resulting movements in real exchange rates have broadly reflected changes in growth prospects and exposures to lower oil prices, and should help support the global recovery.\\nHowever, the financial stability risks around this \\nbaseline are rising and rotating. Although the benefits of the improving baseline are widely distributed and accrue over time, the adverse impact of recent shocks is concen-trated and is already affecting sectors and economies with preexisting vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, continued financial risk taking and structural changes in credit markets are shifting the locus of financial stability risks from advanced economies to emerging markets, from banks to shadow banks, and from solvency to market liquidity risks.• Continued financial risk taking and search for yield keep stretching some asset valuations. The low inter-est rate environment also poses challenges for long-term investors, particularly for weaker life insurance companies in Europe.\\n• Oil- and commodity-exporting countries and firms have been severely affected by falling asset valuations and rising credit risks. Energy and commodity firms in emerging markets, which account for more than a third of nonfinancial corporate bonds issued in hard currency since 2007, have been particularly hard hit. Strains in the debt-repayment capacity of the oil and gas sector have become more evident for firms in Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, and South Africa because of low oil prices, as well as for sovereigns reliant on oil revenues such as Nigeria and Venezuela.\\n• Rapidly depreciating exchange rates have increased pressures on firms that borrowed heavily in for-eign currencies and have sparked significant capital outflows for several emerging markets. These developments could add stress to emerging mar-ket sovereigns that have increased their combined exposure to foreign currency borrowings and foreign investor holdings of local currency debt.\\n• Volatility in major exchange rates has increased by more than during any similar period since the global financial crisis. Reduced liquidity in both the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets, as well as the changing composition of the investor bases in these markets, has added frictions to portfolio adjustments. The resulting tensions in global finan-cial markets have increased market and liquidity risks, given that sudden episodes of volatility could become more common and more pronounced.\\nExisting legacy challenges add to these pressures, leav-ing overall financial stability risks higher.\\nFinancial stability is not fully grounded in advanced \\neconomies, and risks have increased in many emerging markets\\nLong-term bond yields in many advanced economies \\nhave decreased on disinflation concerns and the prospect of continued monetary accommodation. In the euro \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYx International Monetary Fund | April 2015\\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: NAVIGATING MONETARY POLICY CHALLENGES AND MANAGING RISKSarea, almost one-third of short- and long-term sovereign \\nbonds now carry negative yields. But a prolonged low interest rate environment will pose severe challenges for a number of financial institutions. Weak European mid-sized life insurers face a high and rising risk of distress—stress tests (conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) show that 24 percent of insurers may not be able to meet their solvency capital requirements under a prolonged low interest rate scenario. The industry has a portfolio of €4.4 trillion in assets in the European Union, with high and rising interconnectedness with the wider financial system, creating a potential source of spillovers. \\nHigh debt levels in the private sector continue to \\nhinder growth and financial stability. Accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies have helped reduce private sector debt ratios by supporting inflation and growth and by increasing asset prices. However, the assumptions for growth and inflation in this report sug-gest that private sector debt levels in a number of major advanced economies will remain high. This continuing high debt calls for an additional response to address the crisis legacies and unshackle economic potential. Gross corporate debt in France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain is expected to remain above or near 70 percent of GDP by 2020, and gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other major advanced economies. \\nAt the same time there is a clear upside risk to interest \\nrates in the United States. T wo possible scenarios charac-terize the future normalization of U.S. monetary policy: a smooth well-telegraphed exit, or, despite clear com-munication, a bumpy ride with a more rapid decompres-sion of term premiums leading to rapidly rising yields and substantially higher volatility. Indeed, declines in structural liquidity in fixed-income markets in both the United States and other economies have amplified asset price responses to shocks, increasing potential spillovers. Technological change, increased regulation, and the shifting composition of market participants have altered the microstructure of fixed-income markets. Illiquidity events now spill over to other asset classes and to emerg-ing markets, as witnessed in the U.S. T reasury market and in policy-induced instability in foreign exchange markets following the removal of the Swiss franc floor. These developments highlight some key vulnerabilities in capital markets and the shadow banking system.\\nEmerging markets are caught in these global crosscur-\\nrents, as they address their own domestic challenges. Lower commodity prices and lower inflationary pressures are benefiting many emerging market economies, provid-ing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. However, oil- and commodity-exporting countries and countries with high foreign indebtedness face more formidable risks. Although the stronger dollar can help improve competitiveness in emerging market economies in general, and lead to higher growth, the dramatic movements in commodity prices and in the exchange rates of many emerging market economies during the past six months have already had a significant impact on firms’ market valuations in these economies. Many companies borrowed heavily in international markets—substituting international borrowings in dollars for local currency borrowing from banks—potentially leading to balance sheet pressures. \\nIn turn, a retrenchment of overinvested industries, \\nreal estate sector adjustments, and  property price declines—especially in China—could spill over to emerging markets more broadly. The broader impact of a sudden deterioration in corporate health on banking system stability depends on credit exposures. In China, exposures to real estate (excluding mortgages) are almost 20 percent of GDP , and financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spill-overs, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. In 11 of the 21 emerging market banking systems analyzed in this report, more than half of the bank loan books consists of loans to firms, rendering them more exposed to corporate weakness, particularly in Nigeria, Peru, T urkey, and Ukraine.\\nIn a downside risk scenario, further rapid dollar \\nappreciation and an abrupt rise in U.S. interest rates, coupled with a rise in geopolitical risks, could put added pressure on emerging market currencies and asset markets. After a prolonged period of inflows, for-eign investors could abruptly reduce their holdings of local currency debt, thereby adding to turbulence and creating debt rollover challenges. Markets also appear complacent when it comes to geopolitical and politi-cal risks. As noted in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook, ongoing events in Russia and Ukraine, the Middle East, and parts of Africa could lead to greater tensions and increased disruptions to global trade and financial transactions. Direct financial linkages between Russia and the rest of the world are limited, but the indirect connections with neighboring countries could raise financial stability risks. Stronger institutional frameworks in the euro area have reduced the threat exeCutIve su MM ary\\n International Monetary Fund | April 2015 xiof contagion from Greece, but risks and vulnerabilities \\nremain.\\nA range of additional policies are required to \\nincrease policy traction and ground stability \\nThis report assesses the policy responses of cen-\\ntral banks in both advanced and emerging market economies. A key message is that additional policy measures—beyond monetary policies—are required to make a well-grounded exit from the crisis. Poli-cies must address crisis legacies and facilitate sustain-able economic risk taking while containing financial excesses across global markets. \\nTo maximize the impact of quantitative easing in \\nthe euro area, central bank actions must be comple-\\nmented with measures to restore balance sheet health in the private sector, unclog credit channels, enhance the soundness of nonbank institutions, and promote structural reforms. In particular, • Unclogging credit channels requires comprehensive actions to tackle the burden of nonperforming loans. Despite improving bank resilience in the wake of the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment and introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, asset quality continues to deteriorate, although at a slowing pace, with total nonperforming loans now standing at more than €900 billion. Banks should be encouraged to develop and use specialized internal and external capacity for handling the stock of nonperforming assets, actively manage their provisions, and write off their nonperforming assets. Further efforts are needed to improve the effectiveness of legal frame-works governing bankruptcy of companies and individuals. Without corrective policy actions, bank lending capacity could be limited to a meager 1 to 3 percent on average a year.\\n• The challenges facing life insurers should also be tackled promptly. Regulators need to reassess the via-bility of guarantee-based products and work to bring minimum return guarantees offered to policyholders in line with secular trends in policy rates.

However, restrictions on cross-border lending may jeopardize other benefits not examined in the chapter.\\nOversight of asset managers must be proportional to \\nthe risks they pose to the financial system\\nChapter 3 finds that the asset management industry \\nneeds to strengthen its oversight framework in two key areas: better microprudential supervision of risks and adoption of some macroprudential concerns as a stan-dard part of its orientation. Asset management firms can provide credit to the real economy even when banks are distressed, and they have certain advantages over banks from a financial stability perspective. How-ever, the sector’s growth and the structural changes in financial systems have heightened stability concerns. Although the risks posed by leveraged hedge and money market funds are already widely recognized, opinions about less leveraged “plain-vanilla” investment products are divided. \\nHowever, even plain-vanilla products may pose \\nfinancial stability risks through two channels: (1) incentive problems between end investors and portfo-lio managers (which potentially can lead to herding, among other things) and (2) run risk stemming from the presence of liquidity mismatches. The empirical analysis finds evidence of many of these risk-generating mechanisms, although their importance varies across asset markets. Without providing a verdict on whether large asset managers should be designated as systemi-cally important, the analysis indicates that a fund’s investment focus is relatively more important than its size when it comes to its contribution to systemic risk.\\nThese findings suggest that securities regulators \\nshould shift to a more hands-on supervisory model, supported by global standards on supervision and bet-ter data and risk indicators. The roles and adequacy of existing risk-management tools should be reexamined to take into account the asset management industry’s role in systemic risk and the diversity of its products.'],\n",

In advanced economies, the outlook has deteriorated because of heightened uncertainty and set-backs to growth and confidence. Disruptions to global asset markets have added to these pressures. Declines in oil and commodity prices have kept risks elevated in emerging market economies, while greater uncertainty about China’s growth transition has increased spill-overs to global markets. These developments tightened financial conditions, reduced risk appetite, raised credit risks, and stymied balance sheet repair, undermining financial stability.\\nMany market prices dropped dramatically dur-\\ning the turmoil in January and February, moving asset valuations to levels below those consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals that suggest a steady but slowly improving growth path (see the April 2016 World Economic Outlook). Instead, heightened market volatility and risk aversion may have reflected ris-ing economic, financial, and political risks as well as weakened confidence in policies. The recovery in asset prices since February has reversed much of these losses and lowered volatility. Market sentiment has been sup-ported by higher oil and commodity prices, stronger data out of the United States, and supportive actions by central banks. But the net impact of the turmoil has been a shock to confidence, with negative repercus-sions for financial stability.\\nThe main message of this report is that additional \\nmeasures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and infla-tion outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur. In such circumstances, rising risk premiums may tighten financial conditions further, creating a pernicious feed-back loop of fragile confidence, weaker growth, lower inflation, and rising debt burdens. Disruptions to global asset markets could increase the risks of tipping into a more serious and prolonged slowdown marked by finan-cial and economic stagnation. In a situation of financial stagnation, financial institutions responsible for the allocation of capital and mobilization of savings might struggle with impaired balance sheets for an extended period of time. Financial soundness could become eroded to such an extent that both economic growth and financial stability are adversely affected in the medium term. In such a scenario, world output could fall by 3.9 percent relative to the baseline by 2021.\\nPolicymakers need to build on the current economic \\nrecovery and deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability by tackling a triad of global chal-lenges—legacy challenges in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and greater systemic market liquidity risks. Progress along this path will enable the world’s economies to make a decisive break toward a strong and healthy financial system and a sustained recovery. In such a scenario, world output could expand by 1.7 percent relative to the baseline by 2018.\\nAdvanced economies must deal with crisis legacy \\nissues. Banks in advanced economies have become safer in recent years, with stronger capital and liquid-ity buffers and progress in repairing balance sheets. Despite these gains, banks came under market pres-sure at the start of the year, reflecting concerns about the profitability of banks’ business models in a weak economic environment. Approximately 15 percent of banks in advanced economies (by assets) face signifi-cant challenges in attaining sustainable profitability without reform. In the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicat-ing that a more complete solution to European banks’ problems cannot be further postponed.

This increase is \\nlargely a result of growing common exposures to aggre-gate risk, partly because insurers’ interest rate sensitivity has risen and partly because of higher correlations across asset classes. In the event of an adverse shock, therefore, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial inter-mediaries at a time when other parts of the financial system are also struggling to do so. \\nThese findings suggest that a more macroprudential \\napproach to supervision and regulation of insurance companies should be taken. Measures could include regular macroprudential stress testing or the adoption of countercyclical capital buffers. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential poli-cies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers war-rants attention by supervisors.\\nEmerging markets need to bolster their resilience to \\nglobal headwinds. Emerging market economies are faced with a difficult combination of slower growth, weaker commodity prices, and tighter credit condi-tions, amid more volatile portfolio flows. This mixture has kept financial and economic risks elevated. So far, many economies have shown remarkable resilience to this more difficult domestic and external environment, as policymakers have made judicious use of buffers in strengthened policy frameworks. \\nCommodity-related firms are cutting capital \\nexpenditures sharply as high private debt burdens reinforce risks to credit and banks. Commodity-exporting countries and those in the Middle East and the Caucasus are particularly exposed to strains across the real economy and the financial sector. The nexus between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and sovereigns has intensified, and could increase fiscal and financial stability risks in countries with repayment pressures. More broadly, debt belonging to nonfinancial corpora-tions with reduced ability to repay have risen to $650 billion, or 12 percent of total corporate debt of listed firms considered in this report. Bank capital buffers are generally adequate, but will likely be tested by weaker earnings and the downturn in the credit cycle. \\nEmerging market economies generally have the \\ntools to boost their resilience and counter the effects of lower commodity prices and the slowdown in growth and capital flows. Authorities in emerg-ing market economies should continue to use their buffers and policy space, where available, to smooth adjustment and strengthen sovereign and bank bal-ance sheets.

The level of integration explains, for example, why purely financial contagion from China remains less significant even as the impact of Chinese growth shocks is increasingly important for equity returns in both emerging market and advanced economies. As China’s role in the global financial system continues   International Monetary Fund | April 2016 ixRisks to global financial stability have increased \\nsince the October 2015 Global Financial Stabil-\\nity Report. In advanced economies, the outlook has deteriorated because of heightened uncertainty and set-backs to growth and confidence. Disruptions to global asset markets have added to these pressures. Declines in oil and commodity prices have kept risks elevated in emerging market economies, while greater uncertainty about China’s growth transition has increased spill-overs to global markets. These developments tightened financial conditions, reduced risk appetite, raised credit risks, and stymied balance sheet repair, undermining financial stability.\\nMany market prices dropped dramatically dur-\\ning the turmoil in January and February, moving asset valuations to levels below those consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals that suggest a steady but slowly improving growth path (see the April 2016 World Economic Outlook). Instead, heightened market volatility and risk aversion may have reflected ris-ing economic, financial, and political risks as well as weakened confidence in policies. The recovery in asset prices since February has reversed much of these losses and lowered volatility. Market sentiment has been sup-ported by higher oil and commodity prices, stronger data out of the United States, and supportive actions by central banks. But the net impact of the turmoil has been a shock to confidence, with negative repercus-sions for financial stability.\\nThe main message of this report is that additional \\nmeasures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and infla-tion outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur. In such circumstances, rising risk premiums may tighten financial conditions further, creating a pernicious feed-back loop of fragile confidence, weaker growth, lower inflation, and rising debt burdens. Disruptions to global asset markets could increase the risks of tipping into a more serious and prolonged slowdown marked by finan-cial and economic stagnation. In a situation of financial stagnation, financial institutions responsible for the allocation of capital and mobilization of savings might struggle with impaired balance sheets for an extended period of time. Financial soundness could become eroded to such an extent that both economic growth and financial stability are adversely affected in the medium term. In such a scenario, world output could fall by 3.9 percent relative to the baseline by 2021.\\nPolicymakers need to build on the current economic \\nrecovery and deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability by tackling a triad of global chal-lenges—legacy challenges in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and greater systemic market liquidity risks. Progress along this path will enable the world’s economies to make a decisive break toward a strong and healthy financial system and a sustained recovery. In such a scenario, world output could expand by 1.7 percent relative to the baseline by 2018.\\nAdvanced economies must deal with crisis legacy \\nissues. Banks in advanced economies have become safer in recent years, with stronger capital and liquid-ity buffers and progress in repairing balance sheets. Despite these gains, banks came under market pres-sure at the start of the year, reflecting concerns about the profitability of banks’ business models in a weak economic environment. Approximately 15 percent of banks in advanced economies (by assets) face signifi-cant challenges in attaining sustainable profitability without reform. In the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicat-ing that a more complete solution to European banks’ problems cannot be further postponed. Elevated nonperforming loans urgently need to be tackled using a comprehensive strategy, and excess capac-ity in the euro area banking system will have to be addressed over time. In the United States, mortgage markets—which were at the epicenter of the 2008–09 crisis—continue to benefit from significant govern-ment support. Authorities should reinvigorate efforts to reduce the dominance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and continue with reforms of these institutions. \\nChapter 3 shows that across advanced economies, the \\ncontribution of the insurance sector—particularly life insurers—to systemic risk has increased, although not \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARYx International Monetary Fund | April 2016\\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: POTENT POLICIES FOR A SUCCESSFUL NORMALIZATIONyet to the level of the banking sector. This increase is \\nlargely a result of growing common exposures to aggre-gate risk, partly because insurers’ interest rate sensitivity has risen and partly because of higher correlations across asset classes. In the event of an adverse shock, therefore, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial inter-mediaries at a time when other parts of the financial system are also struggling to do so. \\nThese findings suggest that a more macroprudential \\napproach to supervision and regulation of insurance companies should be taken. Measures could include regular macroprudential stress testing or the adoption of countercyclical capital buffers. Steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential poli-cies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. In addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers war-rants attention by supervisors.\\nEmerging markets need to bolster their resilience to \\nglobal headwinds. Emerging market economies are faced with a difficult combination of slower growth, weaker commodity prices, and tighter credit condi-tions, amid more volatile portfolio flows. This mixture has kept financial and economic risks elevated. So far, many economies have shown remarkable resilience to this more difficult domestic and external environment, as policymakers have made judicious use of buffers in strengthened policy frameworks. \\nCommodity-related firms are cutting capital \\nexpenditures sharply as high private debt burdens reinforce risks to credit and banks. Commodity-exporting countries and those in the Middle East and the Caucasus are particularly exposed to strains across the real economy and the financial sector. The nexus between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and sovereigns has intensified, and could increase fiscal and financial stability risks in countries with repayment pressures. More broadly, debt belonging to nonfinancial corpora-tions with reduced ability to repay have risen to $650 billion, or 12 percent of total corporate debt of listed firms considered in this report. Bank capital buffers are generally adequate, but will likely be tested by weaker earnings and the downturn in the credit cycle. \\nEmerging market economies generally have the \\ntools to boost their resilience and counter the effects of lower commodity prices and the slowdown in growth and capital flows. Authorities in emerg-ing market economies should continue to use their buffers and policy space, where available, to smooth adjustment and strengthen sovereign and bank bal-ance sheets. This includes using external buffers, fiscal and monetary policy, and macroprudential and supervisory frameworks, among other tools. Coun-tries with insufficient buffers and limited policy space should act early by adjusting macroeconomic policies to address their vulnerabilities, including by seeking external support. \\nChina’s economic rebalancing is gaining traction. \\nThe country has made notable progress in rebalanc-ing its economy toward new sources of growth and addressing some financial sector risks.

An ambitious policy agenda is required, comprising a more balanced and potent policy mix, including stronger financial reforms together with continuing monetary accommodation. Increased confidence in policies will help reduce vulnerabilities, remove uncertainties, and touch off a virtuous feedback loop between financial markets and the real economy. '],\n",

In a severe and adverse scenario where borrow-ing costs escalate and earnings deteriorate significantly, the debt at risk held by weaker, highly leveraged firms could increase by $740 billion, rising on average to 35 percent of total corporate debt in the sample of firms. In most emerging market economies, reported bank capital buffers and profitability generally remain high and should be sufficient to absorb moderate shocks to nonfinancial companies. Nonetheless, in several economies, weak provisioning and lower levels of bank capital could present difficulties in the event of further balance sheet deterioration in the corporate sector. \\nIn China, the challenge for policymakers is to man-\\nage an orderly transition toward more market disci-pline in the financial system, including the removal of implicit guarantees. In this process, investors and lenders will have to bear some costs of previous finan-cial excesses, and market prices will need to adjust to more accurately reflect risks. Pace is important. If the adjustment is too fast, it risks creating turmoil; if too slow, it will allow vulnerabilities to continue build-ing. Other keys to the success of an orderly transition include upgrading the central bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions.\\nIn the euro area, policies implemented at both \\nthe national and European levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. The restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. Moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. Although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. Thus, European policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. Additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. The resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets.\\nIn Japan, continued monetary accommodation is \\nnecessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. The transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. The first stages of Abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. \\nMore broadly, maintaining the momentum and \\nimpetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. Geopolitical risks related to Ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. Greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. Against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. Furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. \\nChapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of \\nportfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. Their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. Greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets.

The growing activity of institutional investors is potentially more stable, but when fac-ing an extreme shock, they can pull back even more strongly and persistently than other asset managers. While domestic macroeconomic conditions matter, herd behavior among global funds continues, and there are few signs that differentiation along local macroeco-nomic fundamentals during crises has increased over the past 15 years. \\nHowever, the progress made so far by emerging \\nmarket economies in promoting a larger local investor base, deepening their banking sectors and capital mar-kets, and improving their institutions has reduced their sensitivity to global financial shocks. A continuation of these efforts can help emerging market economies reap benefits from financial globalization while minimizing its potential costs. \\nChapter 3 looks at how implicit funding subsidies \\nfor banks considered too important to fail (TITF) have changed over the past few years. Government protection for TITF banks creates a variety of prob-lems: an uneven playing field, excessive risk taking, and large costs for the public sector. Because credi-tors of TITF institutions do not bear the full cost of failure, they are willing to provide funding without paying much attention to the banks’ risk profiles, thereby encouraging leverage and risk taking. Dur-ing the global financial crisis, governments intervened with large amounts of funds to support distressed banks and safeguard financial stability, leaving little uncertainty about their willingness to bail out failing TITF institutions. These developments have further reinforced incentives for banks to become large, and indeed, the concentration of the banking sector in many economies has increased. In response, policy-makers have undertaken ambitious financial reforms to make the financial system safer, including address-ing the TITF problem. \\nChapter 3 assesses whether these policy efforts are \\nsufficient to alleviate the TITF issue. In particular, it investigates the evolution of the funding cost advan-tages enjoyed by systemically important banks (SIBs). The expectation of government support in case of distress represents an implicit public subsidy to those banks. This subsidy rose in all economies during the crisis. Although it has declined in most economies since then, it remains elevated, especially in the euro area, likely reflecting different speeds of balance-sheet repair as well as differences in the policy response to the problems in the banking sector. Nonetheless, the expected probability that SIBs will be bailed out in case of distress has remained high in all regions. \\nAlthough not all measures have been implemented \\nyet, there is still scope for a further strengthening of reforms. These reforms include enhancing capital requirements for SIBs or imposing a financial stabil-ity contribution based on the size of the liabilities of banks. Progress is also needed in facilitating the supervision and resolution of cross-border financial institutions. In these areas, international coordination is critical to avoid new distortions and negative cross-country spillovers, which may have become even more important because of country-specific policy reforms.'],\n",
       " [' International Monetary Fund | October 2014 ixSix years after the start of the crisis, the global \\neconomic recovery continues to rely heavily on accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies to support demand, encourage \\ncorporate investment, and facilitate balance sheet repair. Monetary accommodation remains critical in supporting the economy by encouraging economic risk \\ntaking in advanced economies, in the form of increased \\nreal spending by households and greater willingness to invest and hire by businesses. However, prolonged monetary ease may also encourage excessive financial \\nrisk taking, in the form of increased portfolio alloca-\\ntions to riskier assets and increased willingness to lever-age balance sheets. Thus, accommodative monetary policies face a trade-off between the upside economic benefits and the downside financial stability risks. This report finds that although the economic benefits are becoming more evident in some economies, market and liquidity risks have increased to levels that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed.\\nThe best way to safeguard financial stability and \\nimprove the balance between economic and financial risk taking is to put in place policies that enhance the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy—thus promoting economic risk taking—and address financial excesses through well-designed macropruden-tial measures. \\nEconomic risk taking is advancing but uneven \\nThe October 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO) \\nprojects the global recovery to strengthen modestly this \\nyear and continue into 2015, supported by accom-modative monetary policies in advanced economies and declining headwinds from tighter fiscal policy. However, growth is not yet robust across the globe, and downside risks have risen. Business and consumer confidence remains fragile in many areas, reflecting uncertainties about the recovery of private demand and concerns about incomplete balance sheet repair in banks and corporations. This shortfall in confidence continues to impede greater economic risk taking, making corporations in advanced economies reluctant to ramp up capital investment, despite reasonable earnings growth and access to funding at very low interest rates. Balance sheet repair and monetary policy are now combining to support greater economic risk \\ntaking and a brighter outlook for capital expendi-ture. But prospects are uneven, reflecting a variety of impediments. \\nOn the brighter side is the United States, where \\nbusiness fixed investment has been picking up, although at a slower pace than in previous recover-ies. Capacity utilization is returning to precrisis levels and banks are loosening lending standards, as companies are increasingly focusing on invest-ment rather than equity buybacks. In the euro area, however, growth in business fixed investment remains weak.

Monetary accommodation remains critical in supporting the economy by encouraging economic risk \\ntaking in advanced economies, in the form of increased \\nreal spending by households and greater willingness to invest and hire by businesses. However, prolonged monetary ease may also encourage excessive financial \\nrisk taking, in the form of increased portfolio alloca-\\ntions to riskier assets and increased willingness to lever-age balance sheets. Thus, accommodative monetary policies face a trade-off between the upside economic benefits and the downside financial stability risks. This report finds that although the economic benefits are becoming more evident in some economies, market and liquidity risks have increased to levels that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed.\\nThe best way to safeguard financial stability and \\nimprove the balance between economic and financial risk taking is to put in place policies that enhance the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy—thus promoting economic risk taking—and address financial excesses through well-designed macropruden-tial measures. \\nEconomic risk taking is advancing but uneven \\nThe October 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO) \\nprojects the global recovery to strengthen modestly this \\nyear and continue into 2015, supported by accom-modative monetary policies in advanced economies and declining headwinds from tighter fiscal policy. However, growth is not yet robust across the globe, and downside risks have risen. Business and consumer confidence remains fragile in many areas, reflecting uncertainties about the recovery of private demand and concerns about incomplete balance sheet repair in banks and corporations. This shortfall in confidence continues to impede greater economic risk taking, making corporations in advanced economies reluctant to ramp up capital investment, despite reasonable earnings growth and access to funding at very low interest rates. Balance sheet repair and monetary policy are now combining to support greater economic risk \\ntaking and a brighter outlook for capital expendi-ture. But prospects are uneven, reflecting a variety of impediments. \\nOn the brighter side is the United States, where \\nbusiness fixed investment has been picking up, although at a slower pace than in previous recover-ies. Capacity utilization is returning to precrisis levels and banks are loosening lending standards, as companies are increasingly focusing on invest-ment rather than equity buybacks. In the euro area, however, growth in business fixed investment remains weak.

The share of credit instruments held in mutual fund portfolios has been growing, doubling since 2007, and now amounts to 27 percent of global high-yield debt. At the same time, the fund management industry has become more con-centrated. The top 10 global asset management firms now account for more than $19 trillion in assets under management. The combination of asset concentration, extended portfolio positions and valuations, flight-prone investors, and vulnerable liquidity structures have increased the sensitivity of key credit markets, increasing market and liquidity risks. \\nEmerging markets are more vulnerable to shocks \\nfrom advanced economies, as they now absorb a much larger share of the outward portfolio investment from advanced economies. A consequence of these stronger links is the increased synchronization of asset price movements and volatilities.\\nThese structural changes in credit markets, together \\nwith the expected normalization of monetary policy in the United States, have raised market and liquidity risks in ways that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed. The increased sensitivity of credit markets could make the exit process more volatile, potentially undermining the ability of the financial system to support the recovery.\\nTo illustrate these potential risks to credit markets, \\nthis report examines the impact of a rapid market adjustment that causes term premiums in bond markets to revert to historic norms (increasing by 100 basis points) and credit risk premiums to normalize (a repricing of credit risks by 100 basis points). Such a shock could reduce the market value of global bond portfolios by more than 8 percent, or in excess of $3.8 trillion. If losses on this scale were to materialize over a short time horizon, the ensuing portfolio adjustments and market turmoil could trigger significant disruption in global markets. \\nManaging risks from an ongoing overhaul in bank \\nbusiness models to better support economic risk taking\\nThe policy challenge is to remove impediments to \\neconomic risk taking and strengthen the transmission of credit to the real economy. Banks have come a long way since the global financial crisis. Adjustment has proceeded at different stages, with the first stage focus-ing on emergency stabilization measures. In the second phase, banks have strived to adapt to new business and regulatory realities. Since the start of the crisis, banks hold significantly more capital and have accelerated balance sheet repair. But progress has been uneven across banks and many institutions need to do more to achieve a sustainable business model. \\nToday, low profitability raises concerns about some \\nbanks’ ability to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. Reflecting the size and breadth of the challenge, 80 percent of assets of the largest institu-tions have a return on equity that does not cover the cost of capital required by shareholders. These banks are entering a third phase, in which they will need a more fundamental overhaul of their business models. This will include a combination of repricing existing business lines, reallocating capital across activities, restructuring, or retrenching altogether. \\nBased on a sample of 300 advanced economy banks, \\nthis report finds that many banks have the potential capacity to supply credit, although there is a group of institutions, mostly from the euro area, that would require a high level of repricing to generate sustainable profits and rebuild capital buffers. Such a repricing may not be feasible, especially if done on a stand-alone basis and not followed by other market participants. This could limit these banks’ capacity to meet credit demand, particularly in those countries that are in greatest need of a recovery in credit, and create head-winds for the economic recovery. \\nStrengthening the transmission of credit means, \\nin part, encouraging the prompt and orderly exit of nonviable banks. This would help relieve competi-tive pressures in a context of excess capacity and allow viable banks to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. Regulators can further assist that process by encouraging banks to move away from old practices of cross-subsidizing products and adopt more flexible and transparent business models with product pricing that reflects risks and regulatory requirements. \\nThe credit transmission mechanism will also be \\naided, particularly in Europe, by greater market-based access to credit, including through safe securitization.

Improving the monetary policy trade-off and contain-ing the financial stability risks identified in this report require the effective deployment of a suite of micro- and macroprudential policy tools. This will reduce the need to tighten interest rates earlier than warranted by the needs of the economy. It will also make systemic institutions more resilient, help contain procyclical asset price and credit dynamics, and cushion the conse-quences of liquidity squeezes when volatility returns. \\nMacroprudential measures depend on three steps. \\nFirst, policymakers must have the data necessary to monitor the build-up of financial stability risks. \\nSecond, they must prepare to ensure they have the \\nstatutory authority and analytical capacity to use the macroprudential policy tools that may be needed. This is particularly important in the nonbanking sec-tor, where the regulatory framework is not yet fully in place and needs to be extended to tackle emerg-ing risks. Third, policymakers must have an explicit mandate to act when needed and, equally important, \\nthe courage to act, even when measures are highly unpopular. Effective and balanced communication of the measures undertaken will also be needed.\\nA central concern is the market liquidity risk arising \\nfrom the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when meeting redemptions in times of stress. The policy remedy should seek to address this mismatch, by removing incentives of asset owners to run—by aligning redemption terms of funds with the underlying liquidity in the assets invested—enhanc-ing the accuracy of net asset values, increasing liquid-ity cash buffers in mutual funds, and improving the liquidity and transparency of secondary markets, spe-cifically for longer-term debt markets. Redemption fees that benefit remaining shareholders are one option; however, the calibration of such a fee is challenging and to the extent possible, should not be time varying, as this could encourage asset flight. Similarly, gates to limit redemptions appear to solve some incentive prob-lems, but may simply accelerate redemptions ahead of potential imposition and lead to contagion.\\nPolicymakers should also explore contingency \\nmeasures in cases where illiquidity in markets has the potential for contagion. For advanced economies, bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements could reduce excess volatility by ensuring access to foreign currency funding in times of stress. For emerging markets, in the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning. Possible actions include using cash balances, lowering the supply of long-term debt, and conducting switching auctions to temporarily reduce supply on the long end of yield curves. In addition to bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements to access foreign currency funding in times of stress, mul-tilateral resources such as IMF facilities could provide additional buffers. Keeping emerging market econo-mies resilient calls for an increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities, including weak bank provisioning practices and low loss-absorbing bank buffers in some countries, as discussed in previous reports.\\nFinally, policymakers need to pursue a vigorous \\nagenda of structural reforms in product and labor markets to increase the return on investment and make the recovery more sustainable. \\nGrowth, risks, and regulatory responses to shadow \\nbanking around the world\\nChapter 2 shows that in advanced economies, more \\nnarrowly defined shadow banking measures indicate stagnation, while broader measures (which include investment funds) generally point to continued growth since the global financial crisis.

Data limitations prevent a compre-\\nhensive assessment, but shadow banking in the United States seems to pose a greater risk to domestic financial stability than shadow banking in the euro area and the United Kingdom. \\nPolicymakers need a more encompassing approach \\nto regulation and supervision that focuses on both shadow banking activities and entities and places a greater emphasis on systemic risk. A critical element of that approach is better data on shadow banking.\\nRisk taking, governance, and compensation in banks\\nChapter 3 empirically investigates the relation of risk \\ntaking in banks to banks’ ownership structure, gover-nance, and executive pay incentives. The results show that banks with board members who are independent from bank management tend to take less risk, as do banks whose boards have a risk committee and those that have large institutional ownership. \\nThe level of executive compensation in banks is not \\nconsistently related to risk taking, but more long-term incentive pay is associated with less risk. As expected, periods of severe financial stress alter some of these effects, as incentives change when a bank gets closer to default. In particular, when banks are weak, evidence indicates that shareholders (who are protected by limited liability) have an incentive to make risky bets at the expense of creditors—who expect to be bailed out—and society at large.\\nThese results suggest policy measures, including \\nsome that have been part of the policy debate but had not previously been empirically validated. These mea-sures include making compensation of bank executives more appropriately risk sensitive (including to the risk exposure of bank creditors), deferring some compensa-tion, and providing for clawbacks. Bank boards should be more independent from management and establish risk committees. In addition, supervisors should ensure that board oversight of risk taking in banks is effective. The potential merits (and possible unintentional con-sequences) of including representation for debt holders on bank boards should be studied.

Chapter 2: s overeign Credit Default s waps \\nThe debate about the usefulness of markets for \\nsovereign credit default swaps (SCDS) intensi-fied with the most recent bout of sovereign stress in the euro area. Chapter 2 takes a closer look at whether SCDS markets are good market indicators of sovereign credit risk and whether they provide valuable protection to hedgers; or whether they are prone to speculative excesses and lead to higher sovereign funding costs and financial instability. The chapter finds that many of the negative perceptions are unfounded. The markets for both SCDS and sovereign bonds are similar in their ability to reflect economic fundamentals and market factors. SCDS markets tend to convey new information more rapidly than do the markets for government bonds during periods of stress, although not during other times; but SCDS markets do not appear to be more prone to high volatility than other financial mar-kets. While overshooting was detected in some euro area SCDS markets during the latest bout of stress, there is little evidence that “excessive” increases in a country’s SCDS spreads generally lead to higher sov-ereign funding costs. The question of whether SCDS markets are more likely to be contagious than other markets is difficult to answer because sovereigns and financial institutions are now more interconnected, and hence the risks embedded in SCDS cannot be readily isolated from the risk of the financial system. \\nThe chapter’s results do not support the need for \\na ban on “naked” SCDS protection buying, which went into effect in the European Union in Novem-ber 2012. The policy initiatives underlying the over-the-counter derivatives reforms—mandating better disclosure, encouraging central clearing, and requir-ing the posting of appropriate collateral—should help to allay concerns about spillovers and contagion that may arise in these derivatives markets. \\nChapter 3: Do Central Bank Policies since the \\nCrisis Carry Risks to Financial s tability?\\nChapter 3 returns to the issue of unconventional \\nmonetary policy and its potential side effects with \\nfurther in-depth analysis.

The policies, termed “MP-plus” in the chapter, appear to have lessened banking sector vulnerabilities and contributed to financial stability in the short term—in line with the intentions of the central banks. So far, central bank intervention in specific asset markets has not adversely affected market liquidity. MP-plus policies have improved some indicators of bank soundness, although the evi-dence suggests some reluctance by banks to clean up their balance sheets. Although potential risks raised by MP-plus in the banking system so far appear relatively benign, policymakers should be alert to the possibility that risks may be shifting to other parts of the financial system—shadow banks, pension funds, and insurance companies—due in part to increasing regulatory pressures on banks. Policymakers should use targeted micro- and macroprudential policies to mitigate emerging pockets of vulnerability (identi-fied in Chapter 1) that are likely to increase the longer that MP-plus policies are in use. Implement-ing macroprudential policies in a measured manner, as needed, would allow central banks to continue to use MP-plus to support price stability and growth while protecting financial stability.'],\n",
       " [' International Monetary Fund | October 2012 xieXeCUtIVe  sUMMARY\\nThe analysis in this Global Financial \\nStability Report (GFSR) shows that, \\ndespite recent favorable developments in financial markets, risks to financial stabil-\\nity have increased since the April 2012 GFSR, as confidence in the global financial system has become very fragile. Although significant new efforts by European policymakers have allayed investors’ big-gest fears, the euro area crisis remains the principal source of concern. Tail-risk perceptions surrounding currency redenomination have fueled a retrench-ment of private financial exposures to the euro area periphery. The resulting capital flight and market fragmentation undermine the very foundations of the union: integrated markets and an effective com-mon monetary policy. \\nThe European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) exceptional \\nliquidity operations around the beginning of 2012 eased the pressure on banks to shed assets, but that pressure rose again, accompanied by increasing mar-ket fragmentation. Subsequently, the statement by the president of the ECB in July, and measures pro-posed by the ECB in September to increase liquid-ity support and safeguard an appropriate monetary policy transmission, have been essential in addressing investors’ biggest fears and prompted another market recovery. This GFSR updates work presented in the April 2012 report to assess the impact of bank deleveraging under three scenarios—baseline, weak, \\nand complete policies. We find that delays in resolv-\\ning the crisis have increased the expected amount of asset shrinkage at banks. The largest burden of projected credit supply contractions falls on the euro area periphery, where the combined forces of bank deleveraging and sovereign stress are generating very strong headwinds for the corporate sector. \\nWhere the April 2012 GFSR found the need for \\neuro area policymakers to build on improvements and avoid fresh setbacks, this GFSR finds that more speed is needed now. As detailed in Chapter 1, a leap to the complete policies scenario is neces-sary to restore confidence, reverse capital flight, and reintegrate the euro zone.

Although significant new efforts by European policymakers have allayed investors’ big-gest fears, the euro area crisis remains the principal source of concern. Tail-risk perceptions surrounding currency redenomination have fueled a retrench-ment of private financial exposures to the euro area periphery. The resulting capital flight and market fragmentation undermine the very foundations of the union: integrated markets and an effective com-mon monetary policy. \\nThe European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) exceptional \\nliquidity operations around the beginning of 2012 eased the pressure on banks to shed assets, but that pressure rose again, accompanied by increasing mar-ket fragmentation. Subsequently, the statement by the president of the ECB in July, and measures pro-posed by the ECB in September to increase liquid-ity support and safeguard an appropriate monetary policy transmission, have been essential in addressing investors’ biggest fears and prompted another market recovery. This GFSR updates work presented in the April 2012 report to assess the impact of bank deleveraging under three scenarios—baseline, weak, \\nand complete policies. We find that delays in resolv-\\ning the crisis have increased the expected amount of asset shrinkage at banks. The largest burden of projected credit supply contractions falls on the euro area periphery, where the combined forces of bank deleveraging and sovereign stress are generating very strong headwinds for the corporate sector. \\nWhere the April 2012 GFSR found the need for \\neuro area policymakers to build on improvements and avoid fresh setbacks, this GFSR finds that more speed is needed now. As detailed in Chapter 1, a leap to the complete policies scenario is neces-sary to restore confidence, reverse capital flight, and reintegrate the euro zone. Key elements at the national level include implementation of well-timed and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to reduce external imbalances and promote growth, and completion of the banking sector clean-up, including further steps to recapitalize or restruc-ture viable banks where necessary and to resolve nonviable banks. \\nThese national efforts need to be supported at \\nthe euro area level by sufficient funding to banks through the ECB’s liquidity framework.

Local bond markets have \\ncontinued to attract inflows even as the euro area crisis intensified. Overall, many countries in central and eastern Europe are the most vulnerable because of their direct exposures to the euro area and certain similarities they bear to countries in the euro area periphery. Asia and Latin America generally appear more resilient, but several key regional economies are prone to the risks associated with being in the late phase of a credit cycle that has featured an extended period of rising property prices and debt. Mean-while, the scope to provide fresh policy stimulus is somewhat constrained in several economies, which underscores the need to deftly manage country-specific challenges. \\nThe crisis has spurred a host of regulatory \\nreforms to make the financial system safer. Chap-ter 3 contains an interim report on whether these reforms are moving the financial sector in the right direction against a benchmark set of desirable features—financial institutions and markets that are more transparent, less complex, and less leveraged. The analysis suggests that, although there has been some progress over the past five years, financial sys-tems have not come much closer to those desirable features. They are still overly complex, with strong domestic interbank linkages, and concentrated, with the too-important-to-fail issues unresolved. While there has not yet been any serious setback to financial globalization, in the absence of appropriate policies economies are still susceptible to harmful cross-border spillovers. Progress has been limited partly because many regulatory reforms are still in the early stages of implementation and partly because crisis intervention measures are still in use by a number of economies, delaying the “reboot-ing” of the financial system onto a safer path. Although the reforms currently under way are likely to produce a safer banking system over time, the chapter points to some areas that still require atten-tion: (1)\\xa0a global discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on business activities to address the too-important-to-fail issue, (2) more attention to segments of the nonbank system that may be posing systemic risks, and (3) further progress on recovery and resolution plans for large institutions, especially those that operate across borders. \\nChapter 4 tackles the fundamental question \\nof whether certain aspects of financial structure enhance economic outcomes. Are the forces cur-rently changing financial structures, including regulatory reforms, likely to result in structures that will support higher, less volatile growth and a more stable financial system? The chapter finds that some structural features are indeed associated with better outcomes and others with less growth and more volatility. In particular, financial buffers (both for capital and liquidity) tend to be associated with better economic performance, whereas some types of nontraditional bank intermediation are linked to less favorable results. The analysis also indicates that certain positive characteristics may sometimes turn negative. For instance, some measures of cross-border connections are beneficial most of the time, but if not managed properly they can act as conduits to transmit destabilizing shocks during a crisis. Overall, the analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, since it is constrained by important gaps in data and a relatively short sample period that included the global financial crisis. As a result, the policy conclusions can only be viewed as tenta-tive. Nonetheless, two of those that emerge are that (1)\\xa0financial buffers made up of high-quality capital and truly liquid assets generally help economic per-formance; and (2) banks’ global interconnectivity needs to be managed well so as to reap the benefits of cross-border activities, while limiting adverse spillovers during a crisis.  \\nBoth Chapters 3 and 4 also stress that the success \\nof steps aimed at producing a safer financial system hinges on effective implementation and strong supervision. Without those elements, regulatory reform may fail to secure greater financial stability.'],\n",

Achieving a smooth transition requires policies that man-age the effects of increased volatility and portfolio adjustments, while addressing structural liquidity weaknesses and systemic vulnerabilities. A clear and well-timed communication strategy by central bank officials is critical. Compared with previous tighten-ing cycles, the authorities have a bigger toolkit at their disposal. Yet in the event of adverse shocks, contin-gency backstops may be needed to address the risk of fire sales in some market segments and to manage orderly unwinding or liquidation. Increased oversight would help reduce related risks of excessive leverage in the shadow banking system and, in particular, in the larger mortgage real estate investment trusts. \\n•\\tFor emerging market economies, the principal trans-mission channel of external pressures is more likely to be via liquidity strains in bond and foreign exchange markets, rather than through bank funding chan-nels. In addition, the response of foreign investors to changing expectations for U.S. monetary policy will continue to affect local markets. In the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning, using their policy buffers wisely. Keeping emerging market economies resilient requires increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities as relative growth prospects moderate, U.S. nominal rates rise, and capital flows recede. Policymakers should carefully monitor and contain the rapid growth of corporate leverage. Local bank regulators need to guard against foreign currency funding mismatches affecting bank balance sheets, including through foreign currency borrowing by companies. In addition, establishing sufficient buf-fers and addressing macroeconomic imbalances will likely prove to be worthwhile steps for cushioning against increased volatility and risk premiums. •\\tContaining the risks to China’s financial system is as important as it is challenging. Broad credit growth needs to be reined in to contain financial stability risks and promote the rebalancing of China’s econ-omy away from credit-fueled capital and property investment. It is important that prudential oversight of shadow banking activity be tightened, that incen-tives for regulatory arbitrage be removed through continued financial liberalization (for example, of deposit rates), and that the widespread belief in implicit guarantees and bailouts of risky corporate loans and saving products be counteracted. Unless credit losses are taken by lenders and savers, the state faces large and unpredictable fiscal costs.\\n•\\tJapan’s bold policies need to be completed, with the authorities following through on fiscal and structural policy commitments, to avoid downside risks. These policies are needed to contain a potential sharp rise in government bond risk premiums if sovereign debt dynamics do not improve. To help mitigate stability risks, market structures also need to be made more resilient (such as through the modification of circuit breakers in derivatives markets) and the risk profile of regional banks addressed.\\n•\\tIn the euro area, further progress in reducing debt overhangs and bolstering bank balance sheets needs to go hand in hand with a strengthened euro area financial architecture and the completion of the banking union agenda. Investors’ faith in euro area bank balance sheets needs to be fully restored and credit flows to viable enterprises strengthened: a first step, as planned, is to conduct a thorough, realistic, and transparent balance sheet assessment. Credible capital backstops to meet any identified shortfalls need to be put in place and communicated in advance of the publication of results from the exercise. The corporate debt overhang should be addressed using a more comprehensive approach, including corporate debt cleanups, improvements to corporate bankruptcy frameworks, and active facilitation of nonbank sources of credit. Further monetary support by the European Central Bank and credit support to viable firms by the European Investment Bank are crucial to providing time for the repair of private balance sheets.\\n•\\tGlobal bank capitalization remains diverse, because institutions are at different stages of balance sheet repair and operate in different economic and regula-tory environments.

Further efforts are needed to assess the way in which market developments and regula-tory initiatives affecting dealer-bank business models may influence the cost and provision of market liquidity. At a minimum, increased surveillance of and vigilance over the effects of trading liquidity pressures will be needed as financial markets move to a regime with higher interest rates and volatility. If these policy challenges are properly managed, and \\nif reforms are implemented as promised, the transition toward greater financial stability should prove smooth and provide a more robust platform for financial sector activity and economic growth. But a failure to imple-ment the reforms necessary to address the many policy challenges highlighted above could trigger profound spillovers across regions and potentially derail the smooth transition to greater stability.\\nChapter 2 looks at efforts by policymakers to revive \\nweak credit growth, which has been seen by many as a primary reason behind the slow economic recovery. The chapter catalogues the policies implemented by vari-ous countries and offers a framework for assessing their effectiveness. It argues that policies are most effective if they target the constraints that underlie the weakness in credit. Using several analytical tools, the chapter finds that the constraints in credit markets differ by country and evolve over time, requiring a careful country-by-country assessment. Better data on new lending would also help identify constraints. In many cases, demand- and supply-oriented policies are complementary, but their relative magnitude and sequencing can be impor-tant. Moreover, policymakers should be cognizant of the fiscal costs and implications for financial stability of credit-supporting policies. The main risks center on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of under-writing standards and the risk of “evergreening” existing loans. Mitigation of these risks may not be necessary or appropriate while the economic recovery is still weak because it could run counter to the objectives of the credit policies (which are often designed to increase risk taking); still, policymakers will need to continually weigh the near-term benefits against the longer-run costs of policies aimed at boosting credit.\\nChapter 3 explores how bank funding structures \\naffect financial stability and whether regulatory reform initiatives are likely to make them more stable, diversi-fied, and resilient. The chapter finds that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt—especially short-term wholesale funding that contributed to the global financial crisis—and use deposits as their primary funding source. Various reforms are rightly promoting many of these desirable attributes, but there could be potential trade-offs among them. On the one hand, there are pressures to use more secured fund-ing—which increases asset encumbrance—as well as deposits, to reduce banks’ vulnerability to turbulence in wholesale funding markets. On the other hand, bail-in power and depositor preference give better pro-tection to taxpayers and depositors at the expense of unsecured wholesale debt holders. A numerical analysis illustrates the impact on the cost of unsecured debt as the proportion of newly protected creditors rises. Under current conditions and depositor protections (and especially for well-capitalized banks) the increase would be modest; however, if depositor protections were to be expanded substantially, the impact could be quite large. Careful implementation of the reforms can moderate tensions: Basel III and over-the-counter derivative reforms should be implemented as planned, but policymakers should monitor the increased demand for collateral and ensure that enough unen-cumbered assets are available to permit the meaningful bail-in of unsecured senior creditors.

Even if financial fragmentation is reversed over the medium term, this report estimates that a persistent debt over-hang would remain, amounting to almost one-fifth of the combined corporate debt of Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Assuming no further improvement in economic and financial conditions which would correspond to a more adverse outcome than the cyclical improvement built into the October 2013 World Economic Outlook \\nbaseline scenario, some banks in these economies might need to further increase provisioning to address GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: TRANSITION  ChALLENGES  TO STABILITYxii International Monetary Fund | October 2013the potential deterioration in asset quality of corporate \\nloan books. This could absorb a large portion of future bank profits. Recent efforts to assess asset quality and boost provisions and capital have helped to increase the loss-absorption capacity of banks, but further efforts to cleanse bank balance sheets and to move to full banking union are vital. These steps should be comple-mented by a comprehensive assessment and strategy to address the debt overhang in nonfinancial companies.\\nA number of policy actions can help promote an \\norderly move toward greater financial stability: •\\tStronger growth in the United States is setting the stage for monetary normalization. Achieving a smooth transition requires policies that man-age the effects of increased volatility and portfolio adjustments, while addressing structural liquidity weaknesses and systemic vulnerabilities. A clear and well-timed communication strategy by central bank officials is critical. Compared with previous tighten-ing cycles, the authorities have a bigger toolkit at their disposal. Yet in the event of adverse shocks, contin-gency backstops may be needed to address the risk of fire sales in some market segments and to manage orderly unwinding or liquidation. Increased oversight would help reduce related risks of excessive leverage in the shadow banking system and, in particular, in the larger mortgage real estate investment trusts. \\n•\\tFor emerging market economies, the principal trans-mission channel of external pressures is more likely to be via liquidity strains in bond and foreign exchange markets, rather than through bank funding chan-nels. In addition, the response of foreign investors to changing expectations for U.S. monetary policy will continue to affect local markets. In the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning, using their policy buffers wisely. Keeping emerging market economies resilient requires increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities as relative growth prospects moderate, U.S. nominal rates rise, and capital flows recede. Policymakers should carefully monitor and contain the rapid growth of corporate leverage. Local bank regulators need to guard against foreign currency funding mismatches affecting bank balance sheets, including through foreign currency borrowing by companies. In addition, establishing sufficient buf-fers and addressing macroeconomic imbalances will likely prove to be worthwhile steps for cushioning against increased volatility and risk premiums. •\\tContaining the risks to China’s financial system is as important as it is challenging. Broad credit growth needs to be reined in to contain financial stability risks and promote the rebalancing of China’s econ-omy away from credit-fueled capital and property investment. It is important that prudential oversight of shadow banking activity be tightened, that incen-tives for regulatory arbitrage be removed through continued financial liberalization (for example, of deposit rates), and that the widespread belief in implicit guarantees and bailouts of risky corporate loans and saving products be counteracted. Unless credit losses are taken by lenders and savers, the state faces large and unpredictable fiscal costs.\\n•\\tJapan’s bold policies need to be completed, with the authorities following through on fiscal and structural policy commitments, to avoid downside risks. These policies are needed to contain a potential sharp rise in government bond risk premiums if sovereign debt dynamics do not improve. To help mitigate stability risks, market structures also need to be made more resilient (such as through the modification of circuit breakers in derivatives markets) and the risk profile of regional banks addressed.\\n•\\tIn the euro area, further progress in reducing debt overhangs and bolstering bank balance sheets needs to go hand in hand with a strengthened euro area financial architecture and the completion of the banking union agenda. Investors’ faith in euro area bank balance sheets needs to be fully restored and credit flows to viable enterprises strengthened: a first step, as planned, is to conduct a thorough, realistic, and transparent balance sheet assessment. Credible capital backstops to meet any identified shortfalls need to be put in place and communicated in advance of the publication of results from the exercise. The corporate debt overhang should be addressed using a more comprehensive approach, including corporate debt cleanups, improvements to corporate bankruptcy frameworks, and active facilitation of nonbank sources of credit. Further monetary support by the European Central Bank and credit support to viable firms by the European Investment Bank are crucial to providing time for the repair of private balance sheets.\\n•\\tGlobal bank capitalization remains diverse, because institutions are at different stages of balance sheet repair and operate in different economic and regula-tory environments. The key tasks are to improve ExEcutIvE  su MM ary\\n International Monetary Fund | October 2013 xiiithe credibility, transparency, and strength of balance \\nsheets, while avoiding undue pressures on banks from uncoordinated national regulatory initiatives and uncertainty. Further efforts are needed to assess the way in which market developments and regula-tory initiatives affecting dealer-bank business models may influence the cost and provision of market liquidity. At a minimum, increased surveillance of and vigilance over the effects of trading liquidity pressures will be needed as financial markets move to a regime with higher interest rates and volatility. If these policy challenges are properly managed, and \\nif reforms are implemented as promised, the transition toward greater financial stability should prove smooth and provide a more robust platform for financial sector activity and economic growth. But a failure to imple-ment the reforms necessary to address the many policy challenges highlighted above could trigger profound spillovers across regions and potentially derail the smooth transition to greater stability.\\nChapter 2 looks at efforts by policymakers to revive \\nweak credit growth, which has been seen by many as a primary reason behind the slow economic recovery. The chapter catalogues the policies implemented by vari-ous countries and offers a framework for assessing their effectiveness. It argues that policies are most effective if they target the constraints that underlie the weakness in credit. Using several analytical tools, the chapter finds that the constraints in credit markets differ by country and evolve over time, requiring a careful country-by-country assessment. Better data on new lending would also help identify constraints. In many cases, demand- and supply-oriented policies are complementary, but their relative magnitude and sequencing can be impor-tant. Moreover, policymakers should be cognizant of the fiscal costs and implications for financial stability of credit-supporting policies. The main risks center on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of under-writing standards and the risk of “evergreening” existing loans. Mitigation of these risks may not be necessary or appropriate while the economic recovery is still weak because it could run counter to the objectives of the credit policies (which are often designed to increase risk taking); still, policymakers will need to continually weigh the near-term benefits against the longer-run costs of policies aimed at boosting credit.\\nChapter 3 explores how bank funding structures \\naffect financial stability and whether regulatory reform initiatives are likely to make them more stable, diversi-fied, and resilient. The chapter finds that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt—especially short-term wholesale funding that contributed to the global financial crisis—and use deposits as their primary funding source. Various reforms are rightly promoting many of these desirable attributes, but there could be potential trade-offs among them. On the one hand, there are pressures to use more secured fund-ing—which increases asset encumbrance—as well as deposits, to reduce banks’ vulnerability to turbulence in wholesale funding markets. On the other hand, bail-in power and depositor preference give better pro-tection to taxpayers and depositors at the expense of unsecured wholesale debt holders. A numerical analysis illustrates the impact on the cost of unsecured debt as the proportion of newly protected creditors rises. Under current conditions and depositor protections (and especially for well-capitalized banks) the increase would be modest; however, if depositor protections were to be expanded substantially, the impact could be quite large. Careful implementation of the reforms can moderate tensions: Basel III and over-the-counter derivative reforms should be implemented as planned, but policymakers should monitor the increased demand for collateral and ensure that enough unen-cumbered assets are available to permit the meaningful bail-in of unsecured senior creditors.'],\n",

Much of the proposed financial reform agenda remains unfinished. \\nInternational rule-making bodies have made progress to identify the most egregious failings of the global finan-\\ncial system in the run-up to the crisis, but their member countries have yet to agree on many of the details of the reforms. Dealing with too-important-to-fail entities, strengthening supervisory incentives and resources, and devel-oping the macro-prudential framework are still under discussion. Further progress will require a willingness to sup-\\npress domestic interests in favor of a more stable and better functioning global financial system. The sooner reforms \\ncan be clarified, the sooner financial institutions can formulate their strategic priorities and business models. In the absence of such progress, regulatory inadequacies will continue for some time, increasing the chances of renewed financial instability.\\nAs part of these ongoing efforts, we welcome the recent proposals of the BCBS, which represent a substantial \\nimprovement in the quality and quantity of capital in comparison with the pre-crisis situation. In particular, com-mon equity will represent a higher proportion of capital and thus allow for greater loss absorption. Also, the amount of intangible and qualified assets that can be included in capital will be limited (to 15 percent). These include deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in common shares of financial institutions, and other intangible assets. Phase-in arrangements have been developed to allow banks to move to these higher standards mainly through retention of earnings. As the global financial system stabilizes and the world economic recovery is firmly entrenched, phasing out intangibles completely and scaling back the transition period should be considered. This will raise banking sector resilience to absorb any future shocks that may lie ahead. Furthermore, it is essential to make progress with the overall reform agenda. Putting in place sound micro-prudential regulation is not suffi-cient. Appropriate regulation needs to be developed with a macro-prudential approach to dampen procyclicality and to limit the systemic effects of financial institutions, some of which are not banks.\\nOverall, policymakers cannot relax their efforts to reduce refinancing risks, strengthen balance sheets, and reform \\nregulatory frameworks. As apparent on several occasions over the past three years, conditions in the global financial system now have the potential of jumping from benign to crisis mode very rapidly. Against this backdrop, policy-makers should not squander opportunities to strengthen and recapitalize banking systems, address too-important-to-fail entities, reduce contingent liabilities, and place sovereigns on a credible fiscal path.  With the situation still fragile, some of the public support that has been given to banks in recent years will have to be continued. Planned exit strategies from unconventional monetary and financial policies may need to be delayed until the situation is more robust. At the same time, it is important to ensure that the need for extraordinary support is temporary, as it is no substitute for repairing and reforming financial sectors, and realigning their incentives to build stronger bal-ance sheets and reduce excessive risk taking. \\nFor emerging markets, the policy challenges are different, with most of the financial system risks on the upside. \\nMany will need to cope with the effects of relative success, where maintaining stability will depend on their abil-ity to deal with surges in portfolio inflows. T raditional macroeconomic policies may need to be supplemented in some cases by macro-prudential measures as they may not be fully adequate to meet the macro-financial challenges arising from particular domestic circumstances, such as inflation pressures or asset bubbles. Policies to address high and volatile capital flows are well known (see Chapter 4 of the April 2010 GFSR and IMF Staff Position Note 10/04). Moreover, emerging markets should continue to pursue policies aimed at fostering the development of local financial systems, so that they have the capacity to absorb and safely and efficiently intermediate higher volumes of capital flows.  \\nChapter 2: Systemic Liquidity Risk\\nA defining characteristic of the crisis was the depth and duration of the systemic liquidity disruption to key fund-ing markets—that is, the simultaneous and protracted inability of financial institutions to roll over or obtain new short-term funding across both markets and borders.

In addition, banks have made further progress in recognizing those writedowns, with more than three-quarters of them already reported, leaving a residual amount of approximately $550 billion. There has been less progress, though, in deal-ing with the imminent bank funding pressures: nearly $4 trillion of bank debt will need to be rolled over in the next 24\\xa0months.

Further progress will require a willingness to sup-\\npress domestic interests in favor of a more stable and better functioning global financial system. The sooner reforms \\ncan be clarified, the sooner financial institutions can formulate their strategic priorities and business models.

Also, the amount of intangible and qualified assets that can be included in capital will be limited (to 15 percent). These include deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in common shares of financial institutions, and other intangible assets. Phase-in arrangements have been developed to allow banks to move to these higher standards mainly through retention of earnings. As the global financial system stabilizes and the world economic recovery is firmly entrenched, phasing out intangibles completely and scaling back the transition period should be considered. This will raise banking sector resilience to absorb any future shocks that may lie ahead. Furthermore, it is essential to make progress with the overall reform agenda.

As apparent on several occasions over the past three years, conditions in the global financial system now have the potential of jumping from benign to crisis mode very rapidly. Against this backdrop, policy-makers should not squander opportunities to strengthen and recapitalize banking systems, address too-important-to-fail entities, reduce contingent liabilities, and place sovereigns on a credible fiscal path.  With the situation still fragile, some of the public support that has been given to banks in recent years will have to be continued. Planned exit strategies from unconventional monetary and financial policies may need to be delayed until the situation is more robust. At the same time, it is important to ensure that the need for extraordinary support is temporary, as it is no substitute for repairing and reforming financial sectors, and realigning their incentives to build stronger bal-ance sheets and reduce excessive risk taking. \\nFor emerging markets, the policy challenges are different, with most of the financial system risks on the upside. \\nMany will need to cope with the effects of relative success, where maintaining stability will depend on their abil-ity to deal with surges in portfolio inflows. T raditional macroeconomic policies may need to be supplemented in some cases by macro-prudential measures as they may not be fully adequate to meet the macro-financial challenges arising from particular domestic circumstances, such as inflation pressures or asset bubbles. Policies to address high and volatile capital flows are well known (see Chapter 4 of the April 2010 GFSR and IMF Staff Position Note 10/04). Moreover, emerging markets should continue to pursue policies aimed at fostering the development of local financial systems, so that they have the capacity to absorb and safely and efficiently intermediate higher volumes of capital flows.  \\nChapter 2: Systemic Liquidity Risk\\nA defining characteristic of the crisis was the depth and duration of the systemic liquidity disruption to key fund-ing markets—that is, the simultaneous and protracted inability of financial institutions to roll over or obtain new short-term funding across both markets and borders. Chapter 2 examines this episode and shows how banks became more vulnerable to a funding problem as a result of several factors: new suppliers of wholesale funds that were less-xii International Monetary Fund | October 2010stable providers; greater use of secured lending markets (repurchase agreements) based on cyclically high valuations \\nof collateral (in particular for structured credit products) and insufficient margining processes; growing use of cross-border, short-term funding of longer-term assets in foreign currency; weaknesses in the infrastructure of associated markets; and a lack of information about counterparty risks. Importantly, many were unaware about the extent of interactions between banks and nonbank institutions in the use of short-term funding markets. Hence when central \\nbanks had to step in to stabilize markets, they had to extend liquidity to nonbanks, accept a larger diversity of col-\\nlateral as protection for their lending, set up cross-border foreign currency swap lines, and engage in other actions, all of which raised moral hazard issues that remain unaddressed.\\nMaking progress to mitigate systemic liquidity risk is difficult and not easily measured, as funding markets consist \\nof a diverse set of institutions that interact in multiple markets, each with different infrastructure characteristics. \\nChapter 2 examines this issue, both for institutions and markets. Current proposals focus on micro-prudential mea-\\nsures aimed at improving liquidity buffers and lowering asset/liability mismatches in individual banks—the BCBS proposals being most prominent. While helpful, addressing systemic liquidity risks by raising buffers at one institu-tion does not fully protect against a system-wide liquidity shortage. In these circumstances, central banks will likely need to step in as a liquidity provider of last resort to support markets and institutions. To avoid overuse of central bank facilities and to minimize moral hazard, the liquidity risk framework should focus on ensuring that banks and others considered important to liquidity and maturity transformation are contributing in some form to systemic risk insurance in good times. To do this effectively, a good measure of systemic liquidity risk will have to be developed. However, there are significant data gaps to be addressed in order to appropriately measure and monitor systemic liquidity risks.\\nAlthough mitigating systemic liquidity risk at the level of institutions is certainly part of the answer, funding mar-\\nkets also need attention. Policies to make secured funding markets, such as repurchase (“repo”) markets, function more effectively can help lower systemic risks and prevent liquidity constraints from turning into solvency concerns. Specifically, better collateral valuation rules, margining policies, and the use of central counterparties could all help to lower vulnerabilities. Preventing investor runs from money market mutual funds is also a necessary policy goal. The chapter recommends that stable net asset values (NAVs) not be used for investments in such funds, in order to ensure that fund investors better understand that the value of their investments will fluctuate with market condi-tions. This would need to be initiated carefully and in a period of stable funding conditions to ensure that such a change does not cause the run it was meant to prevent. Other remedies, such as those suggested for banks (higher buffers and less maturity transformation), can also be used to deal with liquidity risks in these funds. In those cases where flexible NAVs are not instituted, it is crucial that such funds be subject to the same requirements as deposit-\\ntaking institutions.\\nChapter 3: Credit Ratings \\nThe recent escalation of sovereign credit risk and the ratings downgrades of structured credit instruments over the \\nlast couple of years have highlighted the financial stability implications of credit rating agencies. Does the informa-tion content provided by ratings have negative implications for financial stability, or is it the way they are used? Chapter 3 sheds light on this issue, using sovereign debt ratings as its focus.  \\nThe use of ratings is mandated in a number of regulatory environments—most notably in capital requirements \\nfor banks in the standardized approach of Basel II. Many private sector entities—pension funds, insurance com-panies, and mutual funds—use ratings or ratings-based indices to make investment decisions. Central banks also use ratings in their collateral policies. Shifts in asset allocations based on ratings downgrades, for instance below an \\ninvestment-grade rating, can be destabilizing, causing forced sales and so-called “cliff effects” in the pricing of such \\nsecurities. The chapter finds that, indeed, ratings matter for the pricing of sovereign debt and that such cliff effects are most prominent when ratings fall below the investment grade barrier. In fact, even before an actual downgrade, GLOBAL  FINANCIAL  STABILIT y REPORT sovereIgns, FundIng, and systeMIc lIquIdIty  International Monetary Fund | October 2010 ixEXECUTIVE SUMMARy\\nThe setback in progress toward financial stability was precipitated by turmoil in the sovereign debt markets in \\nEurope, where increased vulnerabilities of sovereign and bank balance sheets became the focus of market concern. \\nExisting sovereign debt sustainability challenges, combined with concentrated short-term debt rollovers and an undi-versified investor base, left some euro area sovereigns vulnerable to funding pressures. These pressures spilled over to the banking sector, increasing the likelihood of a grim scenario of shrinking credit, slower growth, and weakening \\nbalance sheets. The forceful response at the national and supranational level to address sovereign risks and strengthen \\nconfidence in the financial system, including in particular through the provision of detailed information on bank balance sheets, helped to stabilize funding markets and mitigate risks, but conditions remain fragile. \\nChapter 1 of this report presents an analysis of the challenges facing advanced countries as they deal with \\nthe juxtaposition of a slower recovery, higher debt levels and rollovers, and a still-impaired financial sector. The report starts from the premise that private and sovereign balance sheets will continue to strengthen in a gradually improving economic environment and that policy measures to address legacy problems in key banking systems are implemented alongside important stabilization policies. Nonetheless, higher downside macroeconomic risks, sovereign financing pressures, and intensifying funding strains could produce a difficult environment, requiring adept policy maneuvering.\\nIn Europe, coordinated support programs and the announcement of ambitious fiscal reforms in countries fac-\\ning the greatest funding difficulties helped contain the turmoil in the euro area after its rapid escalation in May. Nevertheless, sovereign risks remain elevated as markets continue to focus on high public debt burdens, unfavorable growth dynamics, increased rollover risks, and linkages to the banking system. Second-tier institutions and banks in countries whose sovereign spreads remain under pressure continue to have only limited access to funding markets and face rising costs. Although governments have put in place national and supranational backstops to ensure that The global financial system is still in a period of significant uncertainty and remains the Achilles’ heel \\nof the economic recovery. Although the ongoing recovery is expected to continue under the baseline scenario, resulting in a gradual strengthening of balance sheets, progress toward global financial sta-bility has experienced a setback since the April 2010 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR). The \\nrecent turmoil in sovereign debt markets in Europe highlighted increased vulnerabilities of bank and \\nsovereign balance sheets arising from the crisis. The financial situation has subsequently improved, owing to the forceful response by policymakers which helped to stabilize funding markets and reduce tail risk, but substantial market uncertainties persist. Global output has expanded in line with earlier projections, with growth in emerging market countries particularly strong. Mature economies are transitioning from temporary support to more self-sustaining private demand. Nevertheless, sover-eign balance sheets are highly vulnerable to growth shocks, making debt sustainability less certain. In this context, policymakers must tackle the following key reforms in order to ensure a viable global \\nfinancial system and safeguard the recovery: (1) deal with the legacy problems in the banking sector, \\nincluding, where necessary, recapitalization; (2) strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets; and (3) continue to clarify and specify regulatory reform, building on the substantial improve-ments proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).x International Monetary Fund | October 2010markets remain open, continuing forceful policy measures are needed to remain firmly on track toward building \\nfinancial system resilience. \\nIn the United States, financial stability has improved, but pockets of vulnerability remain in the banking system. \\nAlthough banks have been able to raise a substantial amount of capital, and expected demands appear manageable, some raising of additional capital may be needed to reverse recent deleveraging trends and possibly to comply with \\nU.S. regulatory reforms. Weakness in the real estate sector constitutes an additional challenge in the United States. \\nTo a large extent, the apparently modest capital needs of U.S. banks reflect the large scale of government-sponsored enterprises and other government interventions without which those needs would have been substantially higher. This highlights the extent to which risk has been transferred from private to public balance sheets, as well as the need to address the burden placed on public institutions.  \\nIn Japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely. So far, the stable domestic \\nsavings base and healthy current account surplus reduce the need to attract external funding sources. Over time, the factors presently supporting the Japanese bond market—high private savings, home bias, and the lack of alternatives to yen-denominated assets—are expected to erode as the population ages and the workforce declines. \\nOverall, emerging markets have proven very resilient to sovereign and banking strains in advanced economies, \\nand most have continued to enjoy access to international capital markets. Cross-border spillover effects were mostly confined to regions with significant economic and financial links to the euro area. With the current slowdown in growth in advanced countries, emerging markets, in general, have become increasingly attractive to investors because of their relatively sound fundamentals and stronger growth potential. This shift in global asset allocation is likely to increase as long as this relative difference persists. However, a potential buildup of macro-financial risks stemming from strong capital inflows—including from excess demand in local markets and possible increased volatility—\\nremains a concern for countries on the receiving end of this ongoing asset reallocation. \\nPolicies to Address Risks \\nPolicymakers in many advanced countries will need to confront the interactions created by slow growth, rising \\nsovereign indebtedness, and still-fragile financial institutions.

That said, recent changes in types of risks taken on by sovereigns (such as \\ncontingent liabilities from the banking sector) imply that better publicly available sovereign risk information would \\nbe helpful to rating agencies and investors.\\nThe credit rating agencies have attempted to produce stable “through-the-cycle” ratings to satisfy clients who find \\nit costly to frequently alter trading decisions that are based on ratings.  The chapter shows that a typical smoothing technique used by at least one rating agency is deemed likely to contribute to procyclicality in ratings compared \\nto a method that accurately reflects current information at a “point in time.” This is because a “through-the-cycle” \\napproach waits to detect whether the degradation is more permanent than temporary and larger than one notch. However, this often means that the lagged timing of the downgrade accentuates the already negative movement in credit quality. \\nOverall the chapter suggests the following policies to lessen some of the adverse side effects that ratings and rating \\nagencies may have on financial stability. \\n•\\t First,\\tregulators\\t should\\tremove\\treferences\\t to\\tratings\\tin\\ttheir\\tregulation\\t where\\tthey\\tare\\tlikely\\tto\\tcause\\tcliff\\teffects,\\t\\nencouraging investors to rely more on their own due diligence.

This opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. For now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.\\nChapter 1\\nAgainst this backdrop, Chapter 1 of the GFSR\\nassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. It measures the reduction \\nin leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. This analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. The most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.\\nBecause the United States remains the \\nepicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, Chapter 1 examines U.S. prospects in some detail. The continuing decline in the U.S. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. With default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on U.S. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the April 2008 GFSR. With the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will \\nincreasingly face losses on non-U.S. assets as \\nwell. In some European countries, too, these \\ndifﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.\\nFinancial institutions had been raising capital \\nto bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. As a result, Chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. A similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed.

Strains in funding EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxivmarkets have increased redemptions in money \\nmarket mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. The far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the U.S. ﬁnancial landscape. While the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.\\nThe ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-\\nation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. Chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. Moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. To the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. Though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. \\nWhereas emerging markets overall had ini-\\ntially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. The cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. Capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. Borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. Policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. There is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-\\ncumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.\\nChapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc \\npolicy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the \\nanalysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous GFSRs. Although the focus has been \\non what the public sector should do, private \\nsector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. The key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\x00Maintain an orderly deleveraging process .\\nFinancial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.\\nv\\x00Strengthen risk management systems .

Other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework. This opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. For now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.\\nChapter 1\\nAgainst this backdrop, Chapter 1 of the GFSR\\nassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. It measures the reduction \\nin leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. This analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. The most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.\\nBecause the United States remains the \\nepicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, Chapter 1 examines U.S. prospects in some detail. The continuing decline in the U.S. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. With default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on U.S. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the April 2008 GFSR. With the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will \\nincreasingly face losses on non-U.S. assets as \\nwell. In some European countries, too, these \\ndifﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.\\nFinancial institutions had been raising capital \\nto bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. As a result, Chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. A similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed. Strains in funding EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxivmarkets have increased redemptions in money \\nmarket mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. The far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the U.S. ﬁnancial landscape. While the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.\\nThe ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-\\nation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. Chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. Moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. To the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. Though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. \\nWhereas emerging markets overall had ini-\\ntially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. The cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. Capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. Borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. Policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. There is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-\\ncumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.\\nChapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc \\npolicy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the \\nanalysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous GFSRs. Although the focus has been \\non what the public sector should do, private \\nsector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. The key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\x00Maintain an orderly deleveraging process .\\nFinancial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.\\nv\\x00Strengthen risk management systems . As part \\nof overall risk management improvements, \\nfirms should endeavor to better align com -\\npensation packages to reward returns on a risk-adjusted basis using more robust risk management practices, with greater emphasis on the long-term component of compensation. \\nv\\x00Improve valuation techniques and reporting.\\nImplementation of new Financial Stability Forum (FSF) disclosure guidelines and fre-quent asset valuations and timely disclosures will reduce uncertainty and are important steps that can help provide information about the health of counterparties.\\nv\\x00Develop better clearing and settlement mechanisms \\nfor over-the-counter products.  Private sector \\nefforts to build clearing and settlement \\nfacilities to lower counterparty risks should \\ncontinue apace, particularly for the credit \\ndefault swaps market, where settlement issues need to be addressed urgently. Higher capital charges for counterparty exposures would EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxvhelp and are being considered by various \\nregulators.\\nChapter 2\\nThe combination of liquidity and solvency \\nrisks has led to a period of elevated short-term interest rate spreads and substantially reduced transaction volumes, with funding markets remaining stressed for an unprecedented period. Chapter 2 delves into the ongoing inability of the bank funding markets to per-form their role in distributing liquidity across banks and near-banks and the consequences for the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission.\\nThe chapter ﬁrst notes that the short-term \\nrates-setting procedures, including for Lon-don Interbank Offer Rates (LIBOR) and the Euribor rate, are not broken, but improve-ments are desirable, since the LIBOR rates are \\nestimated to underpin some $400 trillion of \\nﬁnancial derivatives contracts. Although most \\nof the analysis in the chapter preceded the most recent steep rise in LIBOR rates, the basic recommendations remain intact. In examining the reasons for the elevated spreads between the LIBOR and the overnight index swap (OIS) market, the chapter conﬁrms that default concerns became the overriding component of the U.S. dollar LIBOR-OIS spread starting in early 2008. In addition, foreign currency swap spreads explain the Euribor-OIS and sterling LIBOR-OIS spreads, signifying that U.S. dollar liquidity pressures are spilling over into these other currencies. \\nThe chapter also examines how the interest \\nrate channel of monetary policy transmission has been affected by the crisis, in light of three longer-term trends: increased growth of activity in near-banks, more extensive use of wholesale funding markets, and a movement away from a stable deposit base to a larger proportion of funding obtained with short-term maturities. Although these trends have generally made interest rate transmission more stable, over the last year the smooth relationships between the policy rate and lending rates that had been \\nestablished changed dramatically, particularly for the United States. From mid-2007 until June 2008, the reliability of forecasting lending rates for both the United States and for the euro area has deteriorated, but more so for the United States.\\nThe chapter recommends:\\nv\\x00Improving infrastructure in funding markets.\\nSpecifically, for the calculation of the LIBOR, a larger sample of banks and quotes that also includes nonbank sources of unsecured term funding, as well as publishing aggregate vol-ume data, would engender greater confidence in these benchmark rates.\\nv\\x00More attention to both credit and liquidity risks by \\nthe authorities.  Since wide interbank spreads \\nwere driven primarily by bank distress risks (encompassing both credit and liquidity risks), it is unlikely that ever-easier access to emergency liquidity from central banks will relieve the continued stress in interbank fund-ing. Public authorities will need to continue to address counterparty risks, since private institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.\\nv\\x00Limited indirect support to money markets. Central\\nbank lending facilities aimed at restoring the functioning of interbank markets to transmit monetary policy need to be designed care-fully. They should provide incentives for market participants to start dealing among themselves and thus to allow for an orderly exit by the central bank once more extreme strains have eased. The European Central Bank’s alterations to its collateral policies beginning next year is a step in this direction.\\nv\\x00Encouraging central bank cooperation and com-\\nmunication.  Recent experience has highlighted \\nthe importance of properly functioning forex swap markets in addition to local money mar-kets. In particular, the latest round of liquid-ity distress was countered by the cooperative actions of major central banks to address foreign currency funding needs. Regular communication by central banks about their actions and reasons for them can reduce  xixi\\nConﬁdence in global ﬁnancial institutions \\nand markets has been badly shaken. Threats to systemic stability became \\nmanifest in September with the collapse or near-collapse of several key institutions. The October 2008 World Economic Outlook  notes that \\nthe strains afﬂicting the global ﬁnancial system are expected to deepen the downturn in global growth and restrain the recovery. Moreover, the risk of a more severe adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the broader economy represents a critical threat. The combination of mounting losses, falling asset prices, and a deepening economic downturn, has caused serious doubts about the viability of a widening swath of the ﬁnancial system. The ongoing deleveraging process outlined in the April 2008 GFSR has accelerated and become disorderly—marked by a rapid decline in ﬁnancial institutions’ share prices, higher costs of funding and credit default protection, and depressed asset prices. One result has been sudden failures of institutions as markets have become unwilling (or unable) to provide capital and funding or absorb assets. Piecemeal interventions to address the attendant liquidity strains and resolve the troubled institutions did not succeed in restoring market conﬁdence, as they have not addressed the widespread nature of the underlying problems. The intensifying \\nworries about counterparty risks have created a near lock-up of global money markets. Chapter 1 provides the basis for a more comprehensive policy approach—as is now being considered in some countries. It evaluates how far the delever-aging process has progressed and how much lies ahead. It also suggests a comprehensive set of measures that could arrest the currently destruc-tive process. \\nRestoration of ﬁnancial stability would now \\nbeneﬁt from a publicly-stated collective commit-ment by the authorities of the affected countries to address the issue in a consistent and coherent manner. While the precise measures will inevi-tably differ across countries, experience from earlier crises indicates that ﬁve principles could serve to guide the scope and design of measures that could form the basis for a restoration of conﬁdence in these exceptional circumstances. These include:\\n(1) Employ measures that are comprehensive, \\ntimely, and clearly communicated. They should encompass the principal challenges arising from the strains of deleveraging: namely, improving \\nfunding  availability, cost, and maturity to stabilize \\nbalance sheets; injecting capital  to support viable \\ninstitutions with sound underpinnings that are currently unable to provide adequate credit; and EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nWith ﬁnancial markets worldwide facing growing turmoil, internationally \\ncoherent and decisive policy measures will be required to restore conﬁdence in \\nthe global ﬁnancial system. Failure to do so could usher in a period in which the ongoing deleveraging process becomes increasingly disorderly and costly for the real economy. In any case, the process of restoring an orderly system will be challenging, as a signiﬁcant deleveraging is both necessary and inevitable. It is against this challenging and still evolving backdrop that the \\nGlobal Financial \\nStability Report (GFSR) frames the recent events to suggest potential policy \\nmeasures that could be helpful in the current circumstances. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiibuttressing troubled assets  by using public sector \\nbalance sheets to promote orderly deleverag-ing. In applying existing or new regulations, authorities should avoid exacerbating procyclical effects. The objectives of the measures should be clear and operational procedures transparent.\\n(2) Aim for a consistent and coherent set \\nof policies across countries to stabilize the global ﬁnancial system in order to maximize impact while avoiding adverse effects on other countries.\\n(3) Ensure rapid response on the basis of \\nearly detection of strains. This requires a high degree of coordination within each country, and in many cases across borders, and a framework that allows for decisive action by potentially dif-ferent sets of authorities.\\n(4) Assure that emergency government inter-\\nventions are temporary and taxpayer interests are protected. Accountability of government actions is important for all stakeholders and the conditions for support should include private participation in downside risks and taxpayer participation in upside beneﬁts. Intervention mechanisms should minimize moral hazard, while recognizing the exigency of the situation and the evident need for public support. \\n(5) Pursue the medium-term objective of a \\nmore sound, competitive, and efﬁcient ﬁnancial system. Achieving this objective requires both an orderly resolution of nonviable ﬁnancial institutions and a strengthening of the inter-national macroﬁnancial stability framework to help improve supervision and regulation at the domestic and global levels, as well as mecha-nisms to improve the effectiveness of market discipline. Funding and securitization markets critical to pricing and intermediating credit should be strengthened, including by reducing counterparty risks through centralized clearing organizations.\\nWhile satisfying these guiding principles, \\nconcrete actions are needed to tackle three interrelated areas associated with deleveraging: insufﬁcient capital, falling and uncertain asset valuations, and dysfunctional funding markets. Arresting the spiraling interaction between these three elements is essential if there is to be a \\nmore orderly deleveraging process. \\nCapital.  To keep private sector credit growing, \\neven modestly, while strengthening bank capital ratios, the GFSR estimates some $675 billion in capital would be needed by the major global banks over the next several years. Several mea-sures could be considered:v\\x00With many financial institutions finding it \\nmuch more difficult to raise private capital at the present time, the authorities may need to inject capital into viable institutions. While there are many ways to accomplish this, it is preferable that the scheme provide some upside for the taxpayer, coupled with incen-tives for existing and new private shareholders to provide new capital.\\nv\\x00Though politically difficult, orderly resolution \\nof nonviable banks would demonstrate a com-mitment to a competitive and well-capitalized banking system. Assets.  As private sector balance sheets shed \\nassets to reduce leverage, the use of public sector balance sheets can help prevent “ﬁre-sale” liquidations that threaten to reduce bank capital.v\\x00Countries whose banks have large expo-\\nsures to securitized or problem assets could consider mechanisms for the government to purchase or provide long-term funding for such assets. This should create greater certainty about balance sheet health. Setting up an asset management company provides a framework of legal clarity and accountability for the process. \\nv\\x00Allowing for a greater degree of judgment in \\nthe application of mark-to-market rules may avoid accelerating capital needs by reducing the pressure to value securities at low “fire-sale” prices. Such judgment would require close supervision and should be accompanied by appropriate disclosure in order to avoid undermining confidence in balance sheets of existing institutions.Funding.  Financial institutions that rely on \\nwholesale funding, especially in cross-border markets, have faced severe and mounting reﬁ-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiiinance risks. Central banks therefore are explor-\\ning more ways to extend term ﬁnancing to meet funding needs of institutions. The measures described above to boost capital and underpin asset valuations, as well as those already under-taken to provide liquidity, should provide essen-tial support for the markets to function properly and conﬁdence to be reestablished. Continued progress on reducing counterparty risks, includ-ing centralized clearing and settlement arrange-ments, will also help. But experience in past crises indicates that in some circumstances addi-tional measures may be needed. Under extreme circumstances:v\\x00Deposit insurance of individual retail accounts \\ncould be expanded beyond normal limits. However, expansion of deposit insurance limits or, if conditions deteriorate further, use of a blanket guarantee should only be under-taken as a temporary, emergency measure and is best undertaken in a coordinated fashion across countries.\\nv\\x00Guarantees could cover senior and subordi-\\nnated debt liabilities for a temporary period of time. Ideally, these types of guarantees should include some cost to the institutions receiving coverage, such as a usage fee, fitness test, or other criteria. While these measures represent a broad \\napproach, some of the speciﬁcs have already been put in place by various authorities, and there are encouraging signs that more are being considered. Other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework.

Regular communication by central banks about their actions and reasons for them can reduce EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxivuncertainties. Continued convergence of their \\noperational procedures would also aid in achieving this goal. \\nChapter 3\\nSince the crisis began, the role of fair value \\naccounting (FVA) practices has been under close scrutiny. Chapter 3 examines the poten-tial procyclical role that the application of FVA methods may have played in the development and outcome of the current credit cycle. \\nUsing actual accounting data from ﬁve repre-\\nsentative types of ﬁnancial institutions, this chap-ter simulates the balance sheet effects of several shocks calibrated to recent events. The analysis conﬁrms that, depending on the types of assets and liabilities present on the balance sheet, these shocks amplify cyclical ﬂuctuations of valu-ations. The simulations are also used to examine potential adjustments surrounding FVA meth-ods, showing such adjustments act as expected to smooth the cyclical variation, but by doing so the assigned valuations do not represent fair values. It is worth recognizing, however, that in some cases, such as in highly illiquid markets or in buoyant or dire circumstances, FVA can also produce valuations that do not reﬂect longer-term fundamentals and the cash ﬂows and risks under consideration. \\nOverall, the chapter concludes that the appli-\\ncation of FVA is still the way forward, but that further enhancements of FVA methodologies are needed to help mitigate the exaggerated effects of some valuation techniques. A key chal-lenge will be to enrich the FVA framework so that it can contribute to better market discipline and ﬁnancial stability. The various accounting, prudential, and risk management approaches to valuation should be reconciled so that they work together to promote a more stable ﬁnancial system. Importantly, this will require adjustments on the part of all three disciplines to ensure consistency. \\nThe policy recommendations are:\\nv\\x00Selectively add information on valuation. Account-\\ning valuations themselves need to be supple-mented with additional information, such as \\nthe expected variation of fair value valuations, modeling techniques, and assumptions, so that the user can appropriately assess the risks of the institution. \\nv\\x00Raise capital buffers and provisions.  Higher \\ncapital buffers and the use of forward-looking provisioning would help protect against the downturn in the cycle. If protection against the full magnitude of the downward cycle is desired, then the simulations suggest that building up a capital cushion of some 30–40 percent above normal levels in good times would be required to absorb the most severe shocks.\\nv\\x00Provide targeted risk disclosures.  Firms could \\ncontemplate providing more focused report-ing that is meant to satisfy different needs of users. Shorter reports at higher frequencies may be better than longer reports and lower frequencies, depending on the intended audience.\\nChapter 4\\nEmerging market (EM) countries have \\nnot been at the forefront of the crisis, but their vulnerability to knock-on effects should not be underestimated. Chapter 4 examines equity markets in EM countries to assess the \\nextent to which external/global and domestic/\\nfundamental factors drive equity market \\nvaluations. It conﬁrms that global factors are important in explaining the movement in EM equity prices, as are domestic fundamentals. Using various measures of correlation, Chap-ter 4 also ﬁnds that the scope for spillovers to emerging equity markets has risen, suggesting a growing transmission channel for equity price movements. This can, in turn, affect consump-tion and investment in emerging markets, although such macroﬁnancial linkages are found to be small and they tend to play out gradually. Nevertheless, it suggests that policy-makers need to remain engaged over the longer run in building resilience in their local ﬁnan-cial markets. xixi\\nConﬁdence in global ﬁnancial institutions \\nand markets has been badly shaken.

Funding and securitization markets critical to pricing and intermediating credit should be strengthened, including by reducing counterparty risks through centralized clearing organizations.\\nWhile satisfying these guiding principles, \\nconcrete actions are needed to tackle three interrelated areas associated with deleveraging: insufﬁcient capital, falling and uncertain asset valuations, and dysfunctional funding markets. Arresting the spiraling interaction between these three elements is essential if there is to be a \\nmore orderly deleveraging process. \\nCapital.  To keep private sector credit growing, \\neven modestly, while strengthening bank capital ratios, the GFSR estimates some $675 billion in capital would be needed by the major global banks over the next several years. Several mea-sures could be considered:v\\x00With many financial institutions finding it \\nmuch more difficult to raise private capital at the present time, the authorities may need to inject capital into viable institutions. While there are many ways to accomplish this, it is preferable that the scheme provide some upside for the taxpayer, coupled with incen-tives for existing and new private shareholders to provide new capital.\\nv\\x00Though politically difficult, orderly resolution \\nof nonviable banks would demonstrate a com-mitment to a competitive and well-capitalized banking system. Assets.  As private sector balance sheets shed \\nassets to reduce leverage, the use of public sector balance sheets can help prevent “ﬁre-sale” liquidations that threaten to reduce bank capital.v\\x00Countries whose banks have large expo-\\nsures to securitized or problem assets could consider mechanisms for the government to purchase or provide long-term funding for such assets. This should create greater certainty about balance sheet health. Setting up an asset management company provides a framework of legal clarity and accountability for the process. \\nv\\x00Allowing for a greater degree of judgment in \\nthe application of mark-to-market rules may avoid accelerating capital needs by reducing the pressure to value securities at low “fire-sale” prices. Such judgment would require close supervision and should be accompanied by appropriate disclosure in order to avoid undermining confidence in balance sheets of existing institutions.Funding.  Financial institutions that rely on \\nwholesale funding, especially in cross-border markets, have faced severe and mounting reﬁ-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiiinance risks. Central banks therefore are explor-\\ning more ways to extend term ﬁnancing to meet funding needs of institutions. The measures described above to boost capital and underpin asset valuations, as well as those already under-taken to provide liquidity, should provide essen-tial support for the markets to function properly and conﬁdence to be reestablished. Continued progress on reducing counterparty risks, includ-ing centralized clearing and settlement arrange-ments, will also help. But experience in past crises indicates that in some circumstances addi-tional measures may be needed. Under extreme circumstances:v\\x00Deposit insurance of individual retail accounts \\ncould be expanded beyond normal limits. However, expansion of deposit insurance limits or, if conditions deteriorate further, use of a blanket guarantee should only be under-taken as a temporary, emergency measure and is best undertaken in a coordinated fashion across countries.\\nv\\x00Guarantees could cover senior and subordi-\\nnated debt liabilities for a temporary period of time. Ideally, these types of guarantees should include some cost to the institutions receiving coverage, such as a usage fee, fitness test, or other criteria. While these measures represent a broad \\napproach, some of the speciﬁcs have already been put in place by various authorities, and there are encouraging signs that more are being considered. Other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework. This opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. For now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.\\nChapter 1\\nAgainst this backdrop, Chapter 1 of the GFSR\\nassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. It measures the reduction \\nin leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. This analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. The most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.\\nBecause the United States remains the \\nepicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, Chapter 1 examines U.S. prospects in some detail. The continuing decline in the U.S. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. With default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on U.S. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the April 2008 GFSR. With the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will \\nincreasingly face losses on non-U.S. assets as \\nwell. In some European countries, too, these \\ndifﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.\\nFinancial institutions had been raising capital \\nto bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. As a result, Chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. A similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed. Strains in funding EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxivmarkets have increased redemptions in money \\nmarket mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. The far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the U.S. ﬁnancial landscape. While the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.\\nThe ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-\\nation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. Chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. Moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. To the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. Though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. \\nWhereas emerging markets overall had ini-\\ntially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. The cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. Capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. Borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. Policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. There is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-\\ncumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.\\nChapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc \\npolicy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the \\nanalysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous GFSRs. Although the focus has been \\non what the public sector should do, private \\nsector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. The key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\x00Maintain an orderly deleveraging process .\\nFinancial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.\\nv\\x00Strengthen risk management systems . As part \\nof overall risk management improvements, \\nfirms should endeavor to better align com -\\npensation packages to reward returns on a risk-adjusted basis using more robust risk management practices, with greater emphasis on the long-term component of compensation. \\nv\\x00Improve valuation techniques and reporting.\\nImplementation of new Financial Stability Forum (FSF) disclosure guidelines and fre-quent asset valuations and timely disclosures will reduce uncertainty and are important steps that can help provide information about the health of counterparties.\\nv\\x00Develop better clearing and settlement mechanisms \\nfor over-the-counter products.  Private sector \\nefforts to build clearing and settlement \\nfacilities to lower counterparty risks should \\ncontinue apace, particularly for the credit \\ndefault swaps market, where settlement issues need to be addressed urgently. Higher capital charges for counterparty exposures would EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxvhelp and are being considered by various \\nregulators.\\nChapter 2\\nThe combination of liquidity and solvency \\nrisks has led to a period of elevated short-term interest rate spreads and substantially reduced transaction volumes, with funding markets remaining stressed for an unprecedented period. Chapter 2 delves into the ongoing inability of the bank funding markets to per-form their role in distributing liquidity across banks and near-banks and the consequences for the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission.\\nThe chapter ﬁrst notes that the short-term \\nrates-setting procedures, including for Lon-don Interbank Offer Rates (LIBOR) and the Euribor rate, are not broken, but improve-ments are desirable, since the LIBOR rates are \\nestimated to underpin some $400 trillion of \\nﬁnancial derivatives contracts. Although most \\nof the analysis in the chapter preceded the most recent steep rise in LIBOR rates, the basic recommendations remain intact. In examining the reasons for the elevated spreads between the LIBOR and the overnight index swap (OIS) market, the chapter conﬁrms that default concerns became the overriding component of the U.S. dollar LIBOR-OIS spread starting in early 2008. In addition, foreign currency swap spreads explain the Euribor-OIS and sterling LIBOR-OIS spreads, signifying that U.S. dollar liquidity pressures are spilling over into these other currencies. \\nThe chapter also examines how the interest \\nrate channel of monetary policy transmission has been affected by the crisis, in light of three longer-term trends: increased growth of activity in near-banks, more extensive use of wholesale funding markets, and a movement away from a stable deposit base to a larger proportion of funding obtained with short-term maturities. Although these trends have generally made interest rate transmission more stable, over the last year the smooth relationships between the policy rate and lending rates that had been \\nestablished changed dramatically, particularly for the United States. From mid-2007 until June 2008, the reliability of forecasting lending rates for both the United States and for the euro area has deteriorated, but more so for the United States.\\nThe chapter recommends:\\nv\\x00Improving infrastructure in funding markets.\\nSpecifically, for the calculation of the LIBOR, a larger sample of banks and quotes that also includes nonbank sources of unsecured term funding, as well as publishing aggregate vol-ume data, would engender greater confidence in these benchmark rates.\\nv\\x00More attention to both credit and liquidity risks by \\nthe authorities.  Since wide interbank spreads \\nwere driven primarily by bank distress risks (encompassing both credit and liquidity risks), it is unlikely that ever-easier access to emergency liquidity from central banks will relieve the continued stress in interbank fund-ing. Public authorities will need to continue to address counterparty risks, since private institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.\\nv\\x00Limited indirect support to money markets. Central\\nbank lending facilities aimed at restoring the functioning of interbank markets to transmit monetary policy need to be designed care-fully. They should provide incentives for market participants to start dealing among themselves and thus to allow for an orderly exit by the central bank once more extreme strains have eased. The European Central Bank’s alterations to its collateral policies beginning next year is a step in this direction.\\nv\\x00Encouraging central bank cooperation and com-\\nmunication.  Recent experience has highlighted \\nthe importance of properly functioning forex swap markets in addition to local money mar-kets. In particular, the latest round of liquid-ity distress was countered by the cooperative actions of major central banks to address foreign currency funding needs. Regular communication by central banks about their actions and reasons for them can reduce EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxivuncertainties. Continued convergence of their \\noperational procedures would also aid in achieving this goal. \\nChapter 3\\nSince the crisis began, the role of fair value \\naccounting (FVA) practices has been under close scrutiny. Chapter 3 examines the poten-tial procyclical role that the application of FVA methods may have played in the development and outcome of the current credit cycle. \\nUsing actual accounting data from ﬁve repre-\\nsentative types of ﬁnancial institutions, this chap-ter simulates the balance sheet effects of several shocks calibrated to recent events. The analysis conﬁrms that, depending on the types of assets and liabilities present on the balance sheet, these shocks amplify cyclical ﬂuctuations of valu-ations. The simulations are also used to examine potential adjustments surrounding FVA meth-ods, showing such adjustments act as expected to smooth the cyclical variation, but by doing so the assigned valuations do not represent fair values. It is worth recognizing, however, that in some cases, such as in highly illiquid markets or in buoyant or dire circumstances, FVA can also produce valuations that do not reﬂect longer-term fundamentals and the cash ﬂows and risks under consideration. \\nOverall, the chapter concludes that the appli-\\ncation of FVA is still the way forward, but that further enhancements of FVA methodologies are needed to help mitigate the exaggerated effects of some valuation techniques. A key chal-lenge will be to enrich the FVA framework so that it can contribute to better market discipline and ﬁnancial stability. The various accounting, prudential, and risk management approaches to valuation should be reconciled so that they work together to promote a more stable ﬁnancial system. Importantly, this will require adjustments on the part of all three disciplines to ensure consistency. \\nThe policy recommendations are:\\nv\\x00Selectively add information on valuation. Account-\\ning valuations themselves need to be supple-mented with additional information, such as \\nthe expected variation of fair value valuations, modeling techniques, and assumptions, so that the user can appropriately assess the risks of the institution. \\nv\\x00Raise capital buffers and provisions.  Higher \\ncapital buffers and the use of forward-looking provisioning would help protect against the downturn in the cycle. If protection against the full magnitude of the downward cycle is desired, then the simulations suggest that building up a capital cushion of some 30–40 percent above normal levels in good times would be required to absorb the most severe shocks.\\nv\\x00Provide targeted risk disclosures.  Firms could \\ncontemplate providing more focused report-ing that is meant to satisfy different needs of users. Shorter reports at higher frequencies may be better than longer reports and lower frequencies, depending on the intended audience.\\nChapter 4\\nEmerging market (EM) countries have \\nnot been at the forefront of the crisis, but their vulnerability to knock-on effects should not be underestimated. Chapter 4 examines equity markets in EM countries to assess the \\nextent to which external/global and domestic/\\nfundamental factors drive equity market \\nvaluations. It conﬁrms that global factors are important in explaining the movement in EM equity prices, as are domestic fundamentals. Using various measures of correlation, Chap-ter 4 also ﬁnds that the scope for spillovers to emerging equity markets has risen, suggesting a growing transmission channel for equity price movements. This can, in turn, affect consump-tion and investment in emerging markets, although such macroﬁnancial linkages are found to be small and they tend to play out gradually. Nevertheless, it suggests that policy-makers need to remain engaged over the longer run in building resilience in their local ﬁnan-cial markets.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxviiSpeciﬁcally, the standard policies that could \\nhelp to make markets more resilient in the medium run are well-known and typically include:v\\x00Fostering a broader and more diversified inves-\\ntor base.  Encourage a diversity of investors, \\nincluding institutional investors, such as \\npension funds and insurance companies, \\nwhich tend to have long-term investment \\nhorizons.\\nv\\x00Aiding price discovery.  Remove impediments to \\nprice discovery by avoiding artificial delays in revealing prices or limiting price movements.\\nv\\x00Supporting infrastructure development. Adopt\\nlegal, regulatory, and prudential rules that are consistent with international best practice. \\nv\\x00Ensuring stock exchanges are well run.  A robust \\ntrading environment and supporting infra-structure for trading equities and new finan-cial instruments can also help develop capital markets, although enhancements and innova-\\ntion need to be properly sequenced. \\n* * *\\nA number of the policy lessons arising from \\nthe crisis are now beginning to be implemented and many more will need to be formulated and evaluated before coming into effect. The IMF has been active in the debates on a number of items, some of which have been covered in this latest GFSR. While not all the policy recommendations in the April 2008 GFSR are repeated here, they remain relevant. The IMF will continue to cooperate with the FSF, moni-tor progress, and assist its member countries through its bilateral surveillance, including the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and tech-nical assistance to make their ﬁnancial systems healthier and more resilient to global ﬁnancial sector risks.'],\n",

Thus, policy measures to \\naddress supply constraints may still be needed in some economies.  \\nIn contrast, some emerging market economies have experienced a resurgence of capital \\nflows.

However, with the exception of some local property markets, there is only limited evidence \\nof this actually happening so far.  \\nNonetheless, current conditions warrant close scrutiny and early policy action so as not to \\ncompromise financial stability. Chapter 4 notes that there are strong links between global liquidity \\nexpansion and asset prices in “liquidity -receiving” economies. The work shows that capital inflows in \\nthe rec eiving economies are less problematic if exchange rates are flexible and capital outflows are \\nliberalized. Moreover, policymakers in these economies are encouraged to use a wide range of policy \\noptions in response to the surge in flows —namely macroeconomic  policies and prudential \\nregulations.

One way that is being considered to improve the safety \\nof the system is to assign capital charges on the basis of an institution’s contribution to systemic risk. \\nWhile not necessari ly endorsing its use, Chapter 2 presents a methodology to construct such a capital \\nsurcharge based on financial institutions’ interconnectedness —essentially charging systemically \\nimportant institutions for the externality they impose on the system as a who le—that is, the impact \\ntheir failure would have on others. The methodology relies on techniques already employed by \\nsupervisors and the private sector to manage risk. Other regulatory measures, of course, are also \\npossible, such as those discussed in Secti on F of Chapter 1, and merit further analysis.   \\nAs important as the types  of regulations to put into place is the question of who should  \\ndo it. Chapter 2 also asks whether some recent reform proposals that add the task of monitoring  \\nthe build -up of syst emic risks to the role of regulators would help to mitigate such risks. The  \\nchapter finds that a unified regulator —one that oversees liquidity and solvency issues —removes \\nsome of the conflicting incentives that result from the separation of these powers, but nonetheless  \\nif it is mandated to oversee systemic risks it would still be softer on systemically important \\ninstitutions than on those that are not. This arises because the failure of one of these institutions \\nwould cause disproportionate damage to the  financial system and regulators would be loathe to  \\nsee serial failures. To truly address systemic risks, regulators need additional tools explicitly tied to \\ntheir mandate to monitor systemic risks —altering the structure of regulatory bodies is not enough . \\nSuch tools could include systemic -risk-based capital surcharges, levies on institutions in ways  \\ndirectly related to their contribution to systemic risk, or perhaps even limiting the size of certain \\nbusiness activities.  \\nAnother approach to improving fina ncial stability is to beef up the infrastructure underling \\nfinancial markets to make them more resilient to the distress of individual financial institutions. One \\nof the major initiatives is to move over -the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts to central \\ncounterparties (CCPs) for clearing. Chapter 3 examines how such a move could lower systemic \\ncounterparty credit risks, but notes that once contracts are placed in a CCP it is essential that the risk \\nmanagement standards are high and back -up plans to prevent  a failure of the CCP itself are well \\ndesigned. In the global context, strict regulatory oversight, including a set of international guidelines, \\nis warranted. Such a set of guidelines is currently being crafted jointly by the International \\nOrganization of Securities Commissions and the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems.  \\nThe chapter also notes that while moving OTC derivative contracts to a CCP will likely \\nlower systemic risks by reducing the counterparty risks associated with trading these contr acts, such a \\nmove will bring with it transition costs due to the need to post large amounts of additional collateral \\nat the CCP. This calls for a gradual transition. Given these costs, however, the incentive to \\nvoluntarily move contracts to the safer envir onment may be low and it may need more regulatory \\nencouragement. One way, for example, would be to raise capital charges or attach a levy on \\nderivative exposures that represent a dealer’s payments to their other counterparties in case of their \\nown failure —that is, their contribution to systemic risk in the OTC market.  \\nIn sum, the future financial regulatory reform agenda is still a work in progress, but will need \\nto move forward with at least the main ingredients soon. The window of opportunity for dealing    \\nxi \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRisks to global financial stability have eased as the economic recovery has gained steam, but concerns about \\nadvanced country sovereign risks could undermine stability gains and prolong the collapse of credit. Without \\nmore fully restoring the health of fin ancial and household balance sheets, a worsening of public debt \\nsustainability could be transmitted back to banking systems or across borders. Hence, policies are needed to  \\n(1) reduce sovereign vulnerabilities, including through communicating credible med ium-term fiscal \\nconsolidation plans; (2) ensure that the ongoing deleveraging process unfolds smoothly; and (3) decisively move \\nforward to complete the regulatory agenda so as to move to a safer, more resilient, and dynamic global \\nfinancial system. For eme rging market countries, where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation \\nand asset price bubbles, a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial \\npolicies is advisable.  \\nWith the global economy improving ( see the April 2010 World Economic Outlook ), risks to \\nfinancial stability have subsided. Nonetheless, the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid \\naccumulation of public debt have altered the global risk profile. Vulnerabilities now increasingly \\nemana te from concerns over the sustainability of governments’ balance sheets. In some cases, the \\nlonger -run solvency concerns could translate into short -term strains in funding markets as investors \\nrequire higher yields to compensate for potential future risks.  Such strains can intensify the short -\\nterm funding challenges facing advanced country banks and may have negative implications for a \\nrecovery of private credit. These interactions are covered in Chapter 1 of this report.  \\nBanking system health is generally  improving alongside the economic recovery, continued \\ndeleveraging, and normalizing markets. Our estimates of bank writedowns since the start of the crisis \\nthrough 2010 have been reduced to $2.3 trillion from $2.8 trillion in the October 2009 Global \\nFinanc ial Stability Report . As a result, bank capital needs have declined substantially, although segments \\nof banking systems in some countries remain capital deficient, mainly as a result of losses related to \\ncommercial real estate. Even though capital needs ha ve fallen, banks still face considerable \\nchallenges: a large amount of short -term funding will need to be refinanced this year and next; more \\nand higher -quality capital will likely be needed to satisfy investors in anticipation of upcoming more \\nstringent r egulation; and not all losses have been written down to date. In addition to these \\nchallenges, new regulations will also require banks to rethink their business strategies. All of these \\nfactors are likely to put downward pressure on profitability.  \\nIn such an environment, the recovery of private sector credit is likely to be subdued as credit \\ndemand is weak and supply is constrained. Households and corporates need to reduce their debt \\nlevels and restore their balance sheets. Even with low demand, the balloon ing sovereign financing \\nneeds may bump up against limited credit supply, which could contribute to upward pressure on  \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY    \\n \\n \\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT  \\nInternational Monetary Fund  | April 2010  xii interest rates (see Section D of Chapter 1) and increase funding pressures for banks. Small and \\nmedium -sized enterprises are feeling the b runt of the reduction in credit . Thus, policy measures to \\naddress supply constraints may still be needed in some economies.  \\nIn contrast, some emerging market economies have experienced a resurgence of capital \\nflows. Strong recoveries, expectations of appreciating currencies, as well as ample liquidity and low \\ninterest rates in the major advanced countries form the backdrop for portfolio capital inflows to Asia \\n(excluding Japan) and Latin America (see Section E of Chapter 1, and Chapter 4). While the \\nresumption of capital flows is welcome, in some cases this has led to concerns about the potential for \\ninflationary pressures and a sset price bubbles, which could compromise monetary and financial \\nstability. However, with the exception of some local property markets, there is only limited evidence \\nof this actually happening so far.  \\nNonetheless, current conditions warrant close scrutiny and early policy action so as not to \\ncompromise financial stability. Chapter 4 notes that there are strong links between global liquidity \\nexpansion and asset prices in “liquidity -receiving” economies. The work shows that capital inflows in \\nthe rec eiving economies are less problematic if exchange rates are flexible and capital outflows are \\nliberalized. Moreover, policymakers in these economies are encouraged to use a wide range of policy \\noptions in response to the surge in flows —namely macroeconomic  policies and prudential \\nregulations. If these policy measures are insufficient and the capital flows are likely to be temporary, \\njudicious use of capital controls could be considered.     \\nMain Policy Messages  \\nTo address sovereign risks, credible medium -term fiscal consolidation plans that command \\npublic support are needed. This is the most daunting challenge facing governments in the near term. \\nConsolidation plans should be made transparent, and contingency measures should be in place if the \\ndegradation of public finances is greater than expected. Better fiscal frameworks and growth -\\nenhancing structural reforms will help ground public confidence that the fiscal consolidation process \\nis consistent with long -term growth.  \\nIn the near term, the banking systems in a number of countries still require attention so  \\nas to reestablish a healthy core set of viable banks that can get private credit flowing again. Policies \\nneed to focus on the “right sizing” of a vital and sound financial system. While deleveraging has \\noccurred mostly on the asset side of banks’ balance sheets, funding and liability -side pressures are \\ncoming to the fore. Further efforts to address a number of weak banks are still necessary to ensure a \\nsmooth exit from the extraordinary central bank suppo rt of funding and liquidity. The key will be  \\nfor policymakers to ensure fair competition consistent with a well -functioning and safe banking \\nsystem. While certain central banks and governments may need to continue to provide some  \\nsupport, others should s tand ready to reinstate it, if needed, to avert a return of funding market \\ndisruptions.  \\nLooking further ahead, the regulatory reforms need to move forward expeditiously after \\nbeing adequately calibrated, and be introduced in a manner that accounts for the  current economic \\nand financial conditions. It is already clear that the reforms to make the financial system safer will \\nentail more and better quality capital and improvements in liquidity management and buffers. These \\nmicroprudential measures will help r emove excess capacity and restrict a build -up in leverage. While \\nthe direction of the reforms is clear, the magnitude is not.

The critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps \\nto mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching \\nadjustment, including by preparing contingency \\nand other remediation plans, while also address -\\ning the seeds of the present turmoil.\\nChapter\\t 1—Assessing\\t Risks\\t to\\tGlobal\\t\\nFinancial\\t Stability\\nChapter 1 documents how the crisis is spread -\\ning beyond the U.S. subprime market—namely to \\nthe prime residential and commercial real estate \\nmarkets, consumer credit, and the low- to high-\\ngrade corporate credit markets. The United States \\nremains the epicenter, as the U.S. subprime mar -\\nket was the origin of weakened credit standards \\nand was the first to experience the complications \\narising from the associated structured credit \\nproducts. But financial institutions in other coun -\\ntries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to \\nvarying degree s—weaknesses in risk management \\nsystems and prudential supervision. Industrialized \\ncountries with inflated house price levels relative \\nto fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -\\nhold balance sheets are also at risk.\\nEmerging market countries have been broadly \\nresilient, so far. However, some remain vulner -\\nable to a credit pullback, especially in those \\ncases where domestic credit growth has been \\nfueled from external funding sources and large \\ncurrent account deficits need to be financed. \\nDebt markets, particularly for external corporate \\ndebt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in \\nadvanced countries and costs of funding have \\nrisen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -\\ntite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled \\nout if financial conditions worsen.\\nLosses stemming from credit deterioration \\nand forced sales, as well as reduced earnings \\ngrowth, have significantly tested the balance \\nsheets of both banks and nonbank financial ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxinstitutions. Chapter 1 revisits and extends \\nthe analysis of subprime-related losses in the \\nOctober 2007 GFSR and projects that falling \\nU.S. housing prices  and rising delinquencies \\non mortgage payments  could lead to aggregate \\nlosses related to the residential mortgage market \\nand related securities of about $565 billion, \\nincluding the expected deterioration of prime \\nloans. Adding other categories of loans origi -\\nnated and securities issued in the United States \\nrelated to commercial real estate, the consumer \\ncredit market, and corporations increases aggre -\\ngate potential losses to about $945 billion. These \\nestimates, while based on imprecise information \\nabout exposures and valuation, suggest poten -\\ntial added stress on bank capital and further \\nwritedowns. Moreover, combined with losses to \\nnonbank financial institutions, including mono -\\nline bond insurers, the danger is that there may \\nbe additional reverberations back to the bank -\\ning system as the deleveraging continues. The \\nrisk of litigation over contract performance is \\nalso growing. \\nMacroeconomic feedback effects are also a \\ngrowing concern. Reduced capital buffers and \\nuncertainty about the size and distribution \\nof bank losses, combined with normal credit \\ncycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on \\nhousehold borrowing, business investment, and \\nasset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -\\nment, output growth, and balance sheets. This \\ndynamic has the potential to be more severe \\nthan in previous credit cycles, given the degree \\nof securitization and leverage in the financial \\nsystem. Thus, it is now clear that the current \\nturmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, \\nreflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities \\nand weak capital bases, which means its effects \\nare likely to be broader, deeper, and more \\nprotracted. \\nMacroeconomic policies will have to be the \\nfirst line of defense containing downside risks to \\nthe economy, but policymakers need to move on \\nbroader fronts. A key challenge is to ensure that \\nlarge systemically important financial institu -\\ntions continue to move quickly to repair their \\nbalance sheets, raising equity and medium-term funding, even if it is more costly to do so now, \\nin order to boost confidence and avoid further \\nundermining the credit channel. Equity inflows \\nhave already been forthcoming from various \\ninvestors, including sovereign wealth funds, but \\nmore equity infusions will likely be needed to \\nhelp recapitalize institutions. \\nIn addition to forceful monetary easings by \\na number of major central banks, liquidity has \\nalso been provided to money markets at various \\nmaturities to ensure their smooth function -\\ning. These actions, in some cases coordinated \\nacross central banks, have been supported by a \\nstrengthening of their operational procedures. \\nLooking forward, recent developments suggest \\nthat central banks need to reflect further on \\nthe role that monetary policy may have played \\nin fostering a lack of credit discipline and to \\nimprove their instruments for relieving liquidity \\nstress in today’s more global financial system. \\nHowever, the immediate priority facing poli -\\ncymakers in some mature market countries is \\nto address vulnerabilities to systemic instability \\nin ways that minimize both moral hazard and \\npotential fiscal costs.

In fact, a surprising amount of risk has \\nreturned to the banking system from where it \\nwas allegedly dispersed. Even though the  GFSR \\nand others warned of higher leverage embed -\\nded in the new structured credit instruments \\nand higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -\\ncial institutions) now appear to be far more \\nleveraged than most had anticipated. As well, \\nregulation and supervision of these new instru -\\nments and techniques did not keep pace. \\nWhat follows are a number of short- and \\nmedium-term recommendations relevant to \\nthe current episode. Several others groups and \\nfora—such as the Financial Stability Forum, the \\nJoint Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking \\nSupervision—are concurrently developing their \\nown detailed standards and guidance, much of \\nwhich is likely to address practical issues at a \\ndeeper level than the recommendations pro -\\nposed below. \\nIn the short term...  \\nThe immediate challenge is to reduce the \\nduration and severity of the crisis. Actions that \\nfocus on reducing uncertainty and strength -\\nening confidence in mature market financial \\nsystems should be the first priority. Some steps \\ncan be accomplished by the private sector \\nwithout the need for formal regulation. Others, \\nwhere the public-good nature of the problem \\nprecludes a purely private solution, will require \\nofficial sector involvement.\\nAreas in which the private sector could use -\\nfully contribute are:• Disclosure. Providing timely and consistent \\nreporting of exposures and valuation meth -\\nods to the public, particularly for structured \\ncredit products and other illiquid assets, will \\nhelp alleviate uncertainties about regulated \\nfinancial institutions’ positions. \\n• Bank balance sheet repair. Writedowns, \\nundertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of \\ntheir size can be established, will help cleanse \\nbanks’ balance sheets. Weakly capitalized insti -\\ntutions should immediately seek to raise fresh \\nequity and medium-term funding even if the \\ncost of doing so appears high. \\n• Overall risk management. Institutions could \\nusefully disclose broad strategies that aim to \\ncorrect the risk management failings that \\nmay have contributed to losses and liquidity \\ndifficulties. Governance structures and the \\nintegration of the management of different \\ntypes of risk across the institution need to be \\nimproved. Counterparty risk management \\nhas also resurfaced as an issue to address. A \\nre-examination of the progress made over \\nthe last decade and gaps that are still present \\n(perhaps inadequate information or risk man -\\nagement structures) will need to be closed.  \\n• Managerial compensation structures.  Incen -\\ntives that may act to shorten the horizon of \\ntop management of deposit-taking financial \\ninstitutions need corrective action. Ideally, \\ncompensation at such regulated financial \\ninstitutions should provide incentives to cor -\\nrect risk management failings early, provide \\nfor adequate capital and liquidity buffers, \\nand generally take decisions that enhance the \\nlong-run viability of the firm so as to lessen \\nsystemic risks.\\nShort-term official sector actions would be \\nmost helpful in the following areas:\\n• Consistency of treatment.  Along with audi -\\ntors, supervisors can encourage transparency \\nand ensure the consistency of approach for \\ndifficult-to-value securities so that account -\\ning and valuation discrepancies across global \\nfinancial institutions are minimized. Supervi -\\nsors should be able to evaluate the robustness \\nof the models used by regulated entities to  ixix\\nExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nThe events of the past six months have \\ndemonstrated the fragility of the global \\nfinancial system and raised fundamental \\nquestions about the effectiveness of the \\nresponse by private and public sector institu -\\ntions.

Others, \\nwhere the public-good nature of the problem \\nprecludes a purely private solution, will require \\nofficial sector involvement.\\nAreas in which the private sector could use -\\nfully contribute are:• Disclosure. Providing timely and consistent \\nreporting of exposures and valuation meth -\\nods to the public, particularly for structured \\ncredit products and other illiquid assets, will \\nhelp alleviate uncertainties about regulated \\nfinancial institutions’ positions. \\n• Bank balance sheet repair. Writedowns, \\nundertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of \\ntheir size can be established, will help cleanse \\nbanks’ balance sheets. Weakly capitalized insti -\\ntutions should immediately seek to raise fresh \\nequity and medium-term funding even if the \\ncost of doing so appears high. \\n• Overall risk management. Institutions could \\nusefully disclose broad strategies that aim to \\ncorrect the risk management failings that \\nmay have contributed to losses and liquidity \\ndifficulties. Governance structures and the \\nintegration of the management of different \\ntypes of risk across the institution need to be \\nimproved. Counterparty risk management \\nhas also resurfaced as an issue to address. A \\nre-examination of the progress made over \\nthe last decade and gaps that are still present \\n(perhaps inadequate information or risk man -\\nagement structures) will need to be closed.  \\n• Managerial compensation structures.  Incen -\\ntives that may act to shorten the horizon of \\ntop management of deposit-taking financial \\ninstitutions need corrective action. Ideally, \\ncompensation at such regulated financial \\ninstitutions should provide incentives to cor -\\nrect risk management failings early, provide \\nfor adequate capital and liquidity buffers, \\nand generally take decisions that enhance the \\nlong-run viability of the firm so as to lessen \\nsystemic risks.\\nShort-term official sector actions would be \\nmost helpful in the following areas:\\n• Consistency of treatment.  Along with audi -\\ntors, supervisors can encourage transparency \\nand ensure the consistency of approach for \\ndifficult-to-value securities so that account -\\ning and valuation discrepancies across global \\nfinancial institutions are minimized. Supervi -\\nsors should be able to evaluate the robustness \\nof the models used by regulated entities to executive summary\\nxiiivalue securities. Some latitude in the strict \\napplication of fair value accounting during \\nstressful events may need to be more formally \\nrecognized.\\n• More intense supervision.  Supervisors will \\nneed to better assess capital adequacy related \\nto risks that may not be covered in Pillar 1 of \\nthe Basel II framework. More attention could \\nbe paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -\\npriate risk management system (including for \\nmarket and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -\\nnal governance structure. When supervisors \\nare not satisfied that risk is being appropri -\\nately managed or that adequate contingency \\nplans are in place, they should be able to \\ninsist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.\\n• Special stability reports. To help reduce \\nuncertainty and correct negative public \\nmisperceptions, especially in the current \\ncontext of illiquid, hard-to-value structured \\ncredit securities, special stability reports could \\nbe helpful. Such reports could usefully draw \\non relevant supervisory information, assess \\ncurrent risks objectively, and highlight plans \\nto address vulnerabilities in the countries \\ninvolved. \\n• Early action to resolve troubled institutions. \\nThe public sector should proactively stand \\nready to promptly address stress within \\ntroubled financial institutions. In such cases, \\nearly remedial action or intervention may be \\nwarranted.\\n• Public plans for impaired assets.  National \\nauthorities may wish to prepare contingency \\nplans for dealing with large stocks of impaired \\nassets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -\\nics and significant negative effects on the real \\neconomy. The modalities of doing so will dif -\\nfer across countries and sectors, but success -\\nful instances in which fire sales of impaired \\nassets have been prevented could usefully be \\nemulated.\\nFor emerging market countries, policy actions \\nshould focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the \\nknock-on effects from mature markets. Specifi -\\ncally, banks in countries experiencing rapid \\ncredit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency \\nplans to address reductions in such funding. \\nCountries that have relied on external fund -\\ning should expect to see domestic pressures \\ndevelop if international liquidity becomes \\nscarce. Financial market supervisors in locations \\nwhere housing prices have experienced run-\\nups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures \\nwould be handled and whether the legal setting \\nis conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. \\nNearly all emerging market countries should \\nreview the reliability and depth of detail in \\nfinancial institutions’ public disclosures and the \\nrobustness of their accounting frameworks as \\nuncertainty about the health of major financial \\ninstitutions breeds financial instability. Emerg -\\ning market supervisors, regulators, and central \\nbanks should review their own contingency \\nplans—particularly those related to managing \\nliquidity disruptions. Steps should be taken with \\nhome supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate \\nsuch plans and ongoing supervision.\\nIn the medium term... \\nMore fundamental changes are needed over \\nthe medium term. Policymakers should avoid a \\n“rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly \\nstifle innovation or that could exacerbate the \\neffects of the current credit squeeze. Moreover, \\nthe Basel II capital accord, if implemented \\nrigorously, already provides scope for improve -\\nments in the banking area. Nonetheless, there \\nare areas that need further scrutiny, especially \\nas regards structured products and treatment \\nof off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further \\nadjustments to frameworks are needed. \\nGiven their role in the crisis, structured \\nfinance and the originate-to-distribute business \\nmodel of securitization require a careful exami -\\nnation of what needs to be fixed. It is important \\nto note that securitization, per se, was not the \\nproblem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -\\ning standards in the U.S. mortgage market, the \\nconcomitant extension of securitization into \\nincreasingly complex and difficult-to-understand \\nstructures, collateralized by increasingly lower \\nquality assets, and a favorable financial environ - ixix\\nExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nThe events of the past six months have \\ndemonstrated the fragility of the global \\nfinancial system and raised fundamental \\nquestions about the effectiveness of the \\nresponse by private and public sector institu -\\ntions. While events are still unfolding, the April \\n2008 Global Financial Stability Report  (GFSR) \\nassesses the vulnerabilities that the system is fac -\\ning and offers tentative conclusions and policy \\nlessons. Some key themes that emerge from this \\nanalysis include:\\n• There was a collective failure to appreciate \\nthe extent of leverage taken on by a wide \\nrange of institutions—banks, monoline insur -\\ners, government-sponsored entities, hedge \\nfunds—and the associated risks of a disorderly \\nunwinding.\\n• Private sector risk management, disclosure, \\nfinancial sector supervision, and regulation all \\nlagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts \\nin business models, leaving scope for exces -\\nsive risk-taking, weak underwriting, maturity \\nmismatches, and asset price inflation.\\n• The transfer of risks off bank balance sheets \\nwas overestimated. As risks have materialized, \\nthis has placed enormous pressures back on \\nthe balance sheets of banks.\\n• Notwithstanding unprecedented interven -\\ntion by major central banks, financial mar -\\nkets remain under considerable strain, now \\ncompounded by a more worrisome macroeco -\\nnomic environment, weakly capitalized institu -\\ntions, and broad-based deleveraging.\\nIn sum, the global financial system has \\nundoubtedly come under increasing strains \\nsince the October 2007 GFSR, and risks to \\nfinancial stability remain elevated. The systemic \\nconcerns are exacerbated by a deterioration of \\ncredit quality, a drop in valuations of structured \\ncredit products, and a lack of market liquid -\\nity accompanying a broad deleveraging in the \\nfinancial system. The critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps \\nto mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching \\nadjustment, including by preparing contingency \\nand other remediation plans, while also address -\\ning the seeds of the present turmoil.\\nChapter\\t 1—Assessing\\t Risks\\t to\\tGlobal\\t\\nFinancial\\t Stability\\nChapter 1 documents how the crisis is spread -\\ning beyond the U.S. subprime market—namely to \\nthe prime residential and commercial real estate \\nmarkets, consumer credit, and the low- to high-\\ngrade corporate credit markets. The United States \\nremains the epicenter, as the U.S. subprime mar -\\nket was the origin of weakened credit standards \\nand was the first to experience the complications \\narising from the associated structured credit \\nproducts. But financial institutions in other coun -\\ntries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to \\nvarying degree s—weaknesses in risk management \\nsystems and prudential supervision. Industrialized \\ncountries with inflated house price levels relative \\nto fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -\\nhold balance sheets are also at risk.\\nEmerging market countries have been broadly \\nresilient, so far. However, some remain vulner -\\nable to a credit pullback, especially in those \\ncases where domestic credit growth has been \\nfueled from external funding sources and large \\ncurrent account deficits need to be financed. \\nDebt markets, particularly for external corporate \\ndebt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in \\nadvanced countries and costs of funding have \\nrisen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -\\ntite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled \\nout if financial conditions worsen.\\nLosses stemming from credit deterioration \\nand forced sales, as well as reduced earnings \\ngrowth, have significantly tested the balance \\nsheets of both banks and nonbank financial ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxinstitutions. Chapter 1 revisits and extends \\nthe analysis of subprime-related losses in the \\nOctober 2007 GFSR and projects that falling \\nU.S. housing prices  and rising delinquencies \\non mortgage payments  could lead to aggregate \\nlosses related to the residential mortgage market \\nand related securities of about $565 billion, \\nincluding the expected deterioration of prime \\nloans. Adding other categories of loans origi -\\nnated and securities issued in the United States \\nrelated to commercial real estate, the consumer \\ncredit market, and corporations increases aggre -\\ngate potential losses to about $945 billion. These \\nestimates, while based on imprecise information \\nabout exposures and valuation, suggest poten -\\ntial added stress on bank capital and further \\nwritedowns. Moreover, combined with losses to \\nnonbank financial institutions, including mono -\\nline bond insurers, the danger is that there may \\nbe additional reverberations back to the bank -\\ning system as the deleveraging continues. The \\nrisk of litigation over contract performance is \\nalso growing. \\nMacroeconomic feedback effects are also a \\ngrowing concern. Reduced capital buffers and \\nuncertainty about the size and distribution \\nof bank losses, combined with normal credit \\ncycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on \\nhousehold borrowing, business investment, and \\nasset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -\\nment, output growth, and balance sheets. This \\ndynamic has the potential to be more severe \\nthan in previous credit cycles, given the degree \\nof securitization and leverage in the financial \\nsystem. Thus, it is now clear that the current \\nturmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, \\nreflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities \\nand weak capital bases, which means its effects \\nare likely to be broader, deeper, and more \\nprotracted. \\nMacroeconomic policies will have to be the \\nfirst line of defense containing downside risks to \\nthe economy, but policymakers need to move on \\nbroader fronts. A key challenge is to ensure that \\nlarge systemically important financial institu -\\ntions continue to move quickly to repair their \\nbalance sheets, raising equity and medium-term funding, even if it is more costly to do so now, \\nin order to boost confidence and avoid further \\nundermining the credit channel. Equity inflows \\nhave already been forthcoming from various \\ninvestors, including sovereign wealth funds, but \\nmore equity infusions will likely be needed to \\nhelp recapitalize institutions. \\nIn addition to forceful monetary easings by \\na number of major central banks, liquidity has \\nalso been provided to money markets at various \\nmaturities to ensure their smooth function -\\ning. These actions, in some cases coordinated \\nacross central banks, have been supported by a \\nstrengthening of their operational procedures. \\nLooking forward, recent developments suggest \\nthat central banks need to reflect further on \\nthe role that monetary policy may have played \\nin fostering a lack of credit discipline and to \\nimprove their instruments for relieving liquidity \\nstress in today’s more global financial system. \\nHowever, the immediate priority facing poli -\\ncymakers in some mature market countries is \\nto address vulnerabilities to systemic instability \\nin ways that minimize both moral hazard and \\npotential fiscal costs. In addition to an examina -\\ntion of underlying causes, it will be important \\nto address private sector incentives and com -\\npensation structures so that a similar buildup of \\nvulnerabilities is less likely in the future.   \\nChapter\\t 2—Structured\\t Finance:\\t Issues\\t of\\t\\nValuation\\t and\\tDisclosure\\nThe proliferation of new complex structured \\nfinance products, markets, and business mod -\\nels exposed the financial system to a funding \\ndisruption and a breakdown in confidence.  \\nChapter 2 investigates in some detail how and \\nwhy this set of instruments has had such an \\nadverse effect on financial stability. In particular, \\nit examines the implications for financial stabil -\\nity that arise from the valuation and accounting \\npractices for structured credit products, both at \\norigination and subsequently. The implications \\nfor bank balance sheets of the market pricing of \\nassets during times of stress or shallow markets \\nare also discussed. Because credit rating agen -executive summary\\nxicies continue to play a large role in how these \\nproducts are structured and valued, the chapter \\nexamines how the ratings are produced, finding \\nthat improvements in the models that rating \\nagencies use should be considered. \\nAside from uncertainty surrounding their \\nvaluation and accounting, the business funding \\nmodel for structured credit products appears \\nto have been flawed. These instruments were \\nfrequently housed and financed in bank-associ -\\nated off-balance-sheet entities, such as struc -\\ntured investment vehicles (SIVs) and conduits. \\nThe second part of Chapter 2 investigates the \\nbusiness and regulatory incentives in setting \\nup such legal entities and the failure to address \\ntheir risks in the context of banks’ risk manage -\\nment systems—that is, the piecemeal perimeter \\nof risk consolidation was evidently too narrow \\nfor the risks to be properly assessed. Although \\nasset-liability maturity mismatches are a common \\nfeature of the banking business, these highly \\nleveraged SIVs and conduits took on extreme \\nmaturity mismatches. They relied too heavily \\non wholesale markets for funding, suggesting \\nin turn that adverse incentives and a lack of \\ntransparency were complicit in the strains that \\narose. This also suggests that if risks are allo -\\ncated where they are borne and adequate capi -\\ntal is held against such risks, these entities may \\nbe much less viable—at least in their current \\nform—as a business model.\\nChapter\\t 3—Market\\t and\\tFunding\\t\\nIlliquidity:\\t When\\t Private\\t Risk\\t Becomes\\t\\nPublic\\nAs the crisis progressed from a funding \\nproblem for SIVs and conduits to a widespread \\nreduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk \\nmanagement systems within banks were impli -\\ncated. Chapter 3 looks at the nexus between \\nmarket liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an \\nasset with a small associated price change) and \\nfunding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -\\ntion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely \\nfashion). It finds that some new instruments \\nmay have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -\\nity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. \\nEmpirical work supports the notion that rela -\\ntionships between funding and market liquid -\\nity, both within the United States and among \\nmature economies, have intensified during the \\ncrisis period, whereas prior to the summer of \\n2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. \\nCorrelations between several emerging market \\ndebt and sovereign prices and U.S. funding \\nmarkets also show marked increases during the \\ncrisis, suggesting such financial markets con -\\ntinue to be highly interconnected during crises. \\nChapter 3 notes that trends in the status of \\nlarge banks in advanced countries show these \\nbanks have less protection against a liquidity \\nevent than in the past. The reliance on whole -\\nsale funding and the benign financial environ -\\nment permitted financial firms to become more \\ncomplacent about their liquidity risk manage -\\nment systems and “underinsure” against an \\nadverse liquidity event, depending more heavily \\non central bank intervention for their liquidity \\nproblems. Similarly, bank supervisors had been \\nfocused on the implementation of Basel II, and \\nthe Basel Committee had only recently begun to \\nre-examine liquidity risk issues. \\nLower liquidity in funding markets has \\ninduced unprecedented intervention by central \\nbanks to ease strains in the interbank money \\nmarket. Chapter 3 evaluates the success of such \\nefforts, focusing on the actions of the Federal \\nReserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), \\nand the Bank of England. The ability to provide \\nliquidity to a broad array of counterparties using \\na relatively diverse collateral pool aided the \\neffectiveness of the ECB’s liquidity operations. \\nThe Federal Reserve had to alter its procedures \\nto provide liquidity to the banks that needed \\nit and to reduce the stigma attached to the use \\nof the more widely available discount window. \\nThe Term Auction Facility has worked better, \\nand additional facilities have been established \\nrecently to further contain liquidity pressures. \\nChapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the \\neffectiveness of emergency liquidity support and \\nfinds that Federal Reserve and ECB actions were ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -\\nket interest rates, though the impact on spread \\nlevels appears to have been small. \\nConclusions\\t and\\tPolicy\\t Initiatives\\nAlthough the growth and prosperity of recent \\nyears gave ample illustration of the benefits of \\nfinancial innovation, the events of the past eight \\nmonths have also shown that there are costs. \\nCredit risk transfer products—innovations that \\nwere meant to disperse risk broadly—were not \\nalways used to move risk to those best able to \\nbear it. In fact, a surprising amount of risk has \\nreturned to the banking system from where it \\nwas allegedly dispersed. Even though the  GFSR \\nand others warned of higher leverage embed -\\nded in the new structured credit instruments \\nand higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -\\ncial institutions) now appear to be far more \\nleveraged than most had anticipated. As well, \\nregulation and supervision of these new instru -\\nments and techniques did not keep pace. \\nWhat follows are a number of short- and \\nmedium-term recommendations relevant to \\nthe current episode. Several others groups and \\nfora—such as the Financial Stability Forum, the \\nJoint Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking \\nSupervision—are concurrently developing their \\nown detailed standards and guidance, much of \\nwhich is likely to address practical issues at a \\ndeeper level than the recommendations pro -\\nposed below. \\nIn the short term...  \\nThe immediate challenge is to reduce the \\nduration and severity of the crisis. Actions that \\nfocus on reducing uncertainty and strength -\\nening confidence in mature market financial \\nsystems should be the first priority. Some steps \\ncan be accomplished by the private sector \\nwithout the need for formal regulation.

Policymakers should avoid a \\n“rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly \\nstifle innovation or that could exacerbate the \\neffects of the current credit squeeze. Moreover, \\nthe Basel II capital accord, if implemented \\nrigorously, already provides scope for improve -\\nments in the banking area. Nonetheless, there \\nare areas that need further scrutiny, especially \\nas regards structured products and treatment \\nof off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further \\nadjustments to frameworks are needed. \\nGiven their role in the crisis, structured \\nfinance and the originate-to-distribute business \\nmodel of securitization require a careful exami -\\nnation of what needs to be fixed. It is important \\nto note that securitization, per se, was not the \\nproblem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -\\ning standards in the U.S. mortgage market, the \\nconcomitant extension of securitization into \\nincreasingly complex and difficult-to-understand \\nstructures, collateralized by increasingly lower \\nquality assets, and a favorable financial environ -ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxivment in which risks were insufficiently appre -\\nciated. In retrospect, not enough capital was \\nallocated to cover these risks. Although Chap -\\nter 2 does not attempt an exhaustive analysis of \\nthe adverse incentives that led to the extreme \\ngrowth in structured finance underpinning \\nthe crisis, some tentative policies can be put \\nforward.\\nThe private sector could usefully move in the \\nfollowing directions: \\n• Standardization of some components of \\nstructured finance products. This could help \\nincrease market participants’ understand -\\ning of risks, facilitate the development of a \\nsecondary market with more liquidity, and \\nhelp the comparability of valuation. Standard -\\nization could also facilitate the development \\nof a clearinghouse that would mutualize coun -\\nterparty risks associated with these types of \\nover-the-counter products. \\n• Transparency at origination and subsequently. \\nInvestors will be better able to assess the risk \\nof securitized products if they receive more \\ntimely, comprehensible, and adequate infor -\\nmation about the underlying assets and the \\nsensitivity of valuation to various assumptions. \\n• Reform of rating systems. A differentiated \\nrating scale for structured credit products was \\nrecommended in the April 2006 GFSR. Also, \\nadditional information on the vulnerability \\nof structured credit products to downgrades \\nwould need to accompany the new scale for it \\nto be meaningful. This step may require a re-\\nassessment of the regulatory and supervisory \\ntreatment of rated securities. \\n• Transparency and disclosure. Originators \\nshould disclose to their investors relevant \\naggregate information on key risks in off- balance-sheet entities on a timely and regular \\nbasis.  These should include the reliance by \\ninstitutions on credit risk mitigation instru -\\nments such as insurance, and the degree \\nto which the risks reside with the sponsor, \\nparticularly in cases of distress. More gener -\\nally, convergence of disclosure practices (e.g., \\ntiming and content) internationally should be \\nconsidered by standard setters and regulators.The official sector should examine the fol -\\nlowing areas where the application of various \\nstandards may have systemic consequences. \\n• Greater attention to applying fair value \\naccounting results. The prospects of forced \\nsales triggered by fair value below some \\nthreshold will need to be examined thor -\\noughly. Ways of guiding firms to review the \\nelements underlying the valuation without \\nbeing forced to sell would be helpful. The \\nextent to which such fair value “triggers” are \\neither encouraged or mandated in regulation \\nand supervisory guidance would need to be \\nre-evaluated. It is the role of prudential super -\\nvision to judge the reliability of various meth -\\nods used to establish fair values, especially \\nwhen a marked-to-model approach is used. \\nAccounting standard setters will increasingly \\nneed to take into account the financial stabil -\\nity implications in their accounting practices \\nand guidance.\\n• Incentives to set up SIVs and conduits. In \\nprinciple, Basel II provides less incentive than \\nBasel I to transfer risks to such entities for \\nthe purpose of lowering regulatory capital \\ncharges. Nonetheless, a strict implementation \\nof Basel II by national supervisors, possibly \\narmed with stronger guidance regarding \\nconditions for risk transfer and appropriate \\ncapital relief, will be needed. Accounting stan -\\ndards setters, in cooperation with supervisors, \\nshould revisit consolidation rules to address \\nincentives that may encourage a lack of trans -\\nparency regarding off-balance-sheet activities \\nand risks.  \\n• Tighten oversight of mortgage originators.  \\nIn the United States, broadening 2006 and \\n2007 bank guidance notes on good lending \\npractices to cover nonbank mortgage origi -\\nnators should be considered. The efficiency \\nof coordination across banking regulators \\nwould also be enhanced if the fragmentation \\nacross the various regulatory bodies were \\naddressed. Consideration could be given to \\ndevising mechanisms that would leave origi -\\nnators with a financial stake in the loans they \\noriginate.  ixix\\nExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nThe events of the past six months have \\ndemonstrated the fragility of the global \\nfinancial system and raised fundamental \\nquestions about the effectiveness of the \\nresponse by private and public sector institu -\\ntions.

Moreover, combined with losses to \\nnonbank financial institutions, including mono -\\nline bond insurers, the danger is that there may \\nbe additional reverberations back to the bank -\\ning system as the deleveraging continues. The \\nrisk of litigation over contract performance is \\nalso growing. \\nMacroeconomic feedback effects are also a \\ngrowing concern. Reduced capital buffers and \\nuncertainty about the size and distribution \\nof bank losses, combined with normal credit \\ncycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on \\nhousehold borrowing, business investment, and \\nasset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -\\nment, output growth, and balance sheets. This \\ndynamic has the potential to be more severe \\nthan in previous credit cycles, given the degree \\nof securitization and leverage in the financial \\nsystem. Thus, it is now clear that the current \\nturmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, \\nreflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities \\nand weak capital bases, which means its effects \\nare likely to be broader, deeper, and more \\nprotracted. \\nMacroeconomic policies will have to be the \\nfirst line of defense containing downside risks to \\nthe economy, but policymakers need to move on \\nbroader fronts.

This also suggests that if risks are allo -\\ncated where they are borne and adequate capi -\\ntal is held against such risks, these entities may \\nbe much less viable—at least in their current \\nform—as a business model.\\nChapter\\t 3—Market\\t and\\tFunding\\t\\nIlliquidity:\\t When\\t Private\\t Risk\\t Becomes\\t\\nPublic\\nAs the crisis progressed from a funding \\nproblem for SIVs and conduits to a widespread \\nreduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk \\nmanagement systems within banks were impli -\\ncated. Chapter 3 looks at the nexus between \\nmarket liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an \\nasset with a small associated price change) and \\nfunding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -\\ntion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely \\nfashion). It finds that some new instruments \\nmay have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -\\nity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. \\nEmpirical work supports the notion that rela -\\ntionships between funding and market liquid -\\nity, both within the United States and among \\nmature economies, have intensified during the \\ncrisis period, whereas prior to the summer of \\n2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. \\nCorrelations between several emerging market \\ndebt and sovereign prices and U.S. funding \\nmarkets also show marked increases during the \\ncrisis, suggesting such financial markets con -\\ntinue to be highly interconnected during crises. \\nChapter 3 notes that trends in the status of \\nlarge banks in advanced countries show these \\nbanks have less protection against a liquidity \\nevent than in the past. The reliance on whole -\\nsale funding and the benign financial environ -\\nment permitted financial firms to become more \\ncomplacent about their liquidity risk manage -\\nment systems and “underinsure” against an \\nadverse liquidity event, depending more heavily \\non central bank intervention for their liquidity \\nproblems. Similarly, bank supervisors had been \\nfocused on the implementation of Basel II, and \\nthe Basel Committee had only recently begun to \\nre-examine liquidity risk issues. \\nLower liquidity in funding markets has \\ninduced unprecedented intervention by central \\nbanks to ease strains in the interbank money \\nmarket. Chapter 3 evaluates the success of such \\nefforts, focusing on the actions of the Federal \\nReserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), \\nand the Bank of England. The ability to provide \\nliquidity to a broad array of counterparties using \\na relatively diverse collateral pool aided the \\neffectiveness of the ECB’s liquidity operations. \\nThe Federal Reserve had to alter its procedures \\nto provide liquidity to the banks that needed \\nit and to reduce the stigma attached to the use \\nof the more widely available discount window. \\nThe Term Auction Facility has worked better, \\nand additional facilities have been established \\nrecently to further contain liquidity pressures. \\nChapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the \\neffectiveness of emergency liquidity support and \\nfinds that Federal Reserve and ECB actions were ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -\\nket interest rates, though the impact on spread \\nlevels appears to have been small. \\nConclusions\\t and\\tPolicy\\t Initiatives\\nAlthough the growth and prosperity of recent \\nyears gave ample illustration of the benefits of \\nfinancial innovation, the events of the past eight \\nmonths have also shown that there are costs. \\nCredit risk transfer products—innovations that \\nwere meant to disperse risk broadly—were not \\nalways used to move risk to those best able to \\nbear it. In fact, a surprising amount of risk has \\nreturned to the banking system from where it \\nwas allegedly dispersed. Even though the  GFSR \\nand others warned of higher leverage embed -\\nded in the new structured credit instruments \\nand higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -\\ncial institutions) now appear to be far more \\nleveraged than most had anticipated. As well, \\nregulation and supervision of these new instru -\\nments and techniques did not keep pace. \\nWhat follows are a number of short- and \\nmedium-term recommendations relevant to \\nthe current episode. Several others groups and \\nfora—such as the Financial Stability Forum, the \\nJoint Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking \\nSupervision—are concurrently developing their \\nown detailed standards and guidance, much of \\nwhich is likely to address practical issues at a \\ndeeper level than the recommendations pro -\\nposed below. \\nIn the short term...  \\nThe immediate challenge is to reduce the \\nduration and severity of the crisis. Actions that \\nfocus on reducing uncertainty and strength -\\nening confidence in mature market financial \\nsystems should be the first priority. Some steps \\ncan be accomplished by the private sector \\nwithout the need for formal regulation. Others, \\nwhere the public-good nature of the problem \\nprecludes a purely private solution, will require \\nofficial sector involvement.\\nAreas in which the private sector could use -\\nfully contribute are:• Disclosure. Providing timely and consistent \\nreporting of exposures and valuation meth -\\nods to the public, particularly for structured \\ncredit products and other illiquid assets, will \\nhelp alleviate uncertainties about regulated \\nfinancial institutions’ positions. \\n• Bank balance sheet repair. Writedowns, \\nundertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of \\ntheir size can be established, will help cleanse \\nbanks’ balance sheets. Weakly capitalized insti -\\ntutions should immediately seek to raise fresh \\nequity and medium-term funding even if the \\ncost of doing so appears high. \\n• Overall risk management. Institutions could \\nusefully disclose broad strategies that aim to \\ncorrect the risk management failings that \\nmay have contributed to losses and liquidity \\ndifficulties. Governance structures and the \\nintegration of the management of different \\ntypes of risk across the institution need to be \\nimproved. Counterparty risk management \\nhas also resurfaced as an issue to address. A \\nre-examination of the progress made over \\nthe last decade and gaps that are still present \\n(perhaps inadequate information or risk man -\\nagement structures) will need to be closed.  \\n• Managerial compensation structures.  Incen -\\ntives that may act to shorten the horizon of \\ntop management of deposit-taking financial \\ninstitutions need corrective action. Ideally, \\ncompensation at such regulated financial \\ninstitutions should provide incentives to cor -\\nrect risk management failings early, provide \\nfor adequate capital and liquidity buffers, \\nand generally take decisions that enhance the \\nlong-run viability of the firm so as to lessen \\nsystemic risks.\\nShort-term official sector actions would be \\nmost helpful in the following areas:\\n• Consistency of treatment.  Along with audi -\\ntors, supervisors can encourage transparency \\nand ensure the consistency of approach for \\ndifficult-to-value securities so that account -\\ning and valuation discrepancies across global \\nfinancial institutions are minimized. Supervi -\\nsors should be able to evaluate the robustness \\nof the models used by regulated entities to executive summary\\nxiiivalue securities. Some latitude in the strict \\napplication of fair value accounting during \\nstressful events may need to be more formally \\nrecognized.\\n• More intense supervision.  Supervisors will \\nneed to better assess capital adequacy related \\nto risks that may not be covered in Pillar 1 of \\nthe Basel II framework. More attention could \\nbe paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -\\npriate risk management system (including for \\nmarket and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -\\nnal governance structure. When supervisors \\nare not satisfied that risk is being appropri -\\nately managed or that adequate contingency \\nplans are in place, they should be able to \\ninsist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.\\n• Special stability reports. To help reduce \\nuncertainty and correct negative public \\nmisperceptions, especially in the current \\ncontext of illiquid, hard-to-value structured \\ncredit securities, special stability reports could \\nbe helpful. Such reports could usefully draw \\non relevant supervisory information, assess \\ncurrent risks objectively, and highlight plans \\nto address vulnerabilities in the countries \\ninvolved. \\n• Early action to resolve troubled institutions. \\nThe public sector should proactively stand \\nready to promptly address stress within \\ntroubled financial institutions. In such cases, \\nearly remedial action or intervention may be \\nwarranted.\\n• Public plans for impaired assets.  National \\nauthorities may wish to prepare contingency \\nplans for dealing with large stocks of impaired \\nassets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -\\nics and significant negative effects on the real \\neconomy. The modalities of doing so will dif -\\nfer across countries and sectors, but success -\\nful instances in which fire sales of impaired \\nassets have been prevented could usefully be \\nemulated.\\nFor emerging market countries, policy actions \\nshould focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the \\nknock-on effects from mature markets. Specifi -\\ncally, banks in countries experiencing rapid \\ncredit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency \\nplans to address reductions in such funding. \\nCountries that have relied on external fund -\\ning should expect to see domestic pressures \\ndevelop if international liquidity becomes \\nscarce. Financial market supervisors in locations \\nwhere housing prices have experienced run-\\nups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures \\nwould be handled and whether the legal setting \\nis conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. \\nNearly all emerging market countries should \\nreview the reliability and depth of detail in \\nfinancial institutions’ public disclosures and the \\nrobustness of their accounting frameworks as \\nuncertainty about the health of major financial \\ninstitutions breeds financial instability. Emerg -\\ning market supervisors, regulators, and central \\nbanks should review their own contingency \\nplans—particularly those related to managing \\nliquidity disruptions. Steps should be taken with \\nhome supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate \\nsuch plans and ongoing supervision.\\nIn the medium term... \\nMore fundamental changes are needed over \\nthe medium term. Policymakers should avoid a \\n“rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly \\nstifle innovation or that could exacerbate the \\neffects of the current credit squeeze. Moreover, \\nthe Basel II capital accord, if implemented \\nrigorously, already provides scope for improve -\\nments in the banking area. Nonetheless, there \\nare areas that need further scrutiny, especially \\nas regards structured products and treatment \\nof off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further \\nadjustments to frameworks are needed. \\nGiven their role in the crisis, structured \\nfinance and the originate-to-distribute business \\nmodel of securitization require a careful exami -\\nnation of what needs to be fixed. It is important \\nto note that securitization, per se, was not the \\nproblem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -\\ning standards in the U.S. mortgage market, the \\nconcomitant extension of securitization into \\nincreasingly complex and difficult-to-understand \\nstructures, collateralized by increasingly lower \\nquality assets, and a favorable financial environ -ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxivment in which risks were insufficiently appre -\\nciated. In retrospect, not enough capital was \\nallocated to cover these risks. Although Chap -\\nter 2 does not attempt an exhaustive analysis of \\nthe adverse incentives that led to the extreme \\ngrowth in structured finance underpinning \\nthe crisis, some tentative policies can be put \\nforward.\\nThe private sector could usefully move in the \\nfollowing directions: \\n• Standardization of some components of \\nstructured finance products. This could help \\nincrease market participants’ understand -\\ning of risks, facilitate the development of a \\nsecondary market with more liquidity, and \\nhelp the comparability of valuation. Standard -\\nization could also facilitate the development \\nof a clearinghouse that would mutualize coun -\\nterparty risks associated with these types of \\nover-the-counter products. \\n• Transparency at origination and subsequently. \\nInvestors will be better able to assess the risk \\nof securitized products if they receive more \\ntimely, comprehensible, and adequate infor -\\nmation about the underlying assets and the \\nsensitivity of valuation to various assumptions. \\n• Reform of rating systems. A differentiated \\nrating scale for structured credit products was \\nrecommended in the April 2006 GFSR. Also, \\nadditional information on the vulnerability \\nof structured credit products to downgrades \\nwould need to accompany the new scale for it \\nto be meaningful. This step may require a re-\\nassessment of the regulatory and supervisory \\ntreatment of rated securities. \\n• Transparency and disclosure. Originators \\nshould disclose to their investors relevant \\naggregate information on key risks in off- balance-sheet entities on a timely and regular \\nbasis.  These should include the reliance by \\ninstitutions on credit risk mitigation instru -\\nments such as insurance, and the degree \\nto which the risks reside with the sponsor, \\nparticularly in cases of distress. More gener -\\nally, convergence of disclosure practices (e.g., \\ntiming and content) internationally should be \\nconsidered by standard setters and regulators.The official sector should examine the fol -\\nlowing areas where the application of various \\nstandards may have systemic consequences. \\n• Greater attention to applying fair value \\naccounting results. The prospects of forced \\nsales triggered by fair value below some \\nthreshold will need to be examined thor -\\noughly. Ways of guiding firms to review the \\nelements underlying the valuation without \\nbeing forced to sell would be helpful. The \\nextent to which such fair value “triggers” are \\neither encouraged or mandated in regulation \\nand supervisory guidance would need to be \\nre-evaluated. It is the role of prudential super -\\nvision to judge the reliability of various meth -\\nods used to establish fair values, especially \\nwhen a marked-to-model approach is used. \\nAccounting standard setters will increasingly \\nneed to take into account the financial stabil -\\nity implications in their accounting practices \\nand guidance.\\n• Incentives to set up SIVs and conduits. In \\nprinciple, Basel II provides less incentive than \\nBasel I to transfer risks to such entities for \\nthe purpose of lowering regulatory capital \\ncharges. Nonetheless, a strict implementation \\nof Basel II by national supervisors, possibly \\narmed with stronger guidance regarding \\nconditions for risk transfer and appropriate \\ncapital relief, will be needed. Accounting stan -\\ndards setters, in cooperation with supervisors, \\nshould revisit consolidation rules to address \\nincentives that may encourage a lack of trans -\\nparency regarding off-balance-sheet activities \\nand risks.  \\n• Tighten oversight of mortgage originators.  \\nIn the United States, broadening 2006 and \\n2007 bank guidance notes on good lending \\npractices to cover nonbank mortgage origi -\\nnators should be considered. The efficiency \\nof coordination across banking regulators \\nwould also be enhanced if the fragmentation \\nacross the various regulatory bodies were \\naddressed. Consideration could be given to \\ndevising mechanisms that would leave origi -\\nnators with a financial stake in the loans they \\noriginate. executive summary\\nxvAnother area in which weaknesses contrib -\\nuted to the crisis is financial institutions’ liquid -\\nity management. It is now obvious that various \\nfactors may have encouraged financial institu -\\ntions to insufficiently protect themselves against \\nan adverse liquidity event—a situation that \\nneeds to be addressed.\\nFor financial institutions, the crisis has pro -\\nvided many important lessons including those \\ninvolving:\\n• Liquidity risk management. Firms will need to \\nfactor in more severe price jumps (“gapping”) \\nand correlation movements in their market \\nrisk models, employing adjustments to risk \\nmeasures where possible. Better stress tests \\ncould be undertaken with longer periods of \\nfunding illiquidity and improved contingency \\nplans. More transparency regarding how \\nliquidity risk is managed within the firm could \\nbe available to investors.\\n• More realistic assumptions about the liquidity \\nof complex structured securities. Firms’ reli -\\nance on highly structured securities to gener -\\nate collateral proved problematic during the \\ncrisis. Greater availability on balance sheets of \\nhighly liquid assets to use as collateral could \\nallow institutions easier access to funding \\nsources during periods of stress.\\nFinancial regulators and supervisory authori -\\nties also need to take a more active role in \\nreviewing liquidity management issues and \\nsupervisory guidance, and considering other \\nregulatory improvements.• \\nStrengthen existing international liquidity \\nguidance. The Basel Committee’s Working \\nGroup on Liquidity is already considering \\nhow to strengthen its existing guidance in this \\narea, and prompt review would be welcome. \\nThe use of multiple currencies for funding \\nglobally active banks suggests that a more uni -\\nfied approach to liquidity management across \\ncountries may be needed. \\n• Monitoring best practices. A better method \\nof monitoring progress toward achieving \\n“best practices” for liquidity management \\n(e.g., those of the Basel Committee, the Joint \\nForum, and the Institute of International Finance) could help prevent gaps across \\ninstitutions. If progress is insufficient, a  Pillar 2-like system may be needed, whereby \\nsupervisors are tasked with ensuring that \\nadequate bank liquidity management systems \\nare in place and that banks hold sufficient \\nliquidity buffers and have well-formulated \\ncontingency plans.\\nMonetary authorities as well need to review \\ntheir operational practices in light of the crisis. \\nThis event has required unprecedented liquidity \\ninfusions to the interbank market and the use \\nof operational instruments that had not been \\nused before. Central banks should now converge \\nto policies that have worked during the crisis to \\nimprove the functioning of interbank markets \\nand better distribute liquidity. Such policies to \\nbe considered are the following :\\n• Broader range of collateral. To be expedi -\\nent, central banks need to be able to oper -\\nate with a wide range of collateral, perhaps \\nagreeing on collateral that could be posted \\nat multiple central banks. However, central \\nbanks will need to have a well-established \\ncollateral pricing policy to avoid taking \\nundue credit and liquidity risks onto their \\nown balance sheets.\\n• Wide group of counterparties.  Central banks \\nshould have a wide group of counterparty \\nbanks established during normal times that \\nare eligible to receive liquidity during stressful \\ntimes. Altering this group during periods of \\nstress can signal that certain banks, with per -\\nhaps newly acceptable collateral, are receiving \\npreferential treatment.\\n• Maturity structure of liquidity provision. \\nOperational procedures enabling the provi -\\nsion of liquidity at different maturities can be \\nhelpful. However, altering the maturity profile \\nof the central bank’s balance sheet needs to \\nbe accompanied by communication indicat -\\ning how this is consistent with the monetary \\npolicy strategy.\\n• Better coordination among financial over -\\nseers.  Central banks and others with over -\\nsight over financial institutions could usefully \\ndevelop closer ties and improved information  ixix\\nExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nThe events of the past six months have \\ndemonstrated the fragility of the global \\nfinancial system and raised fundamental \\nquestions about the effectiveness of the \\nresponse by private and public sector institu -\\ntions. While events are still unfolding, the April \\n2008 Global Financial Stability Report  (GFSR) \\nassesses the vulnerabilities that the system is fac -\\ning and offers tentative conclusions and policy \\nlessons. Some key themes that emerge from this \\nanalysis include:\\n• There was a collective failure to appreciate \\nthe extent of leverage taken on by a wide \\nrange of institutions—banks, monoline insur -\\ners, government-sponsored entities, hedge \\nfunds—and the associated risks of a disorderly \\nunwinding.\\n• Private sector risk management, disclosure, \\nfinancial sector supervision, and regulation all \\nlagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts \\nin business models, leaving scope for exces -\\nsive risk-taking, weak underwriting, maturity \\nmismatches, and asset price inflation.\\n• The transfer of risks off bank balance sheets \\nwas overestimated. As risks have materialized, \\nthis has placed enormous pressures back on \\nthe balance sheets of banks.\\n• Notwithstanding unprecedented interven -\\ntion by major central banks, financial mar -\\nkets remain under considerable strain, now \\ncompounded by a more worrisome macroeco -\\nnomic environment, weakly capitalized institu -\\ntions, and broad-based deleveraging.\\nIn sum, the global financial system has \\nundoubtedly come under increasing strains \\nsince the October 2007 GFSR, and risks to \\nfinancial stability remain elevated. The systemic \\nconcerns are exacerbated by a deterioration of \\ncredit quality, a drop in valuations of structured \\ncredit products, and a lack of market liquid -\\nity accompanying a broad deleveraging in the \\nfinancial system. The critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps \\nto mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching \\nadjustment, including by preparing contingency \\nand other remediation plans, while also address -\\ning the seeds of the present turmoil.\\nChapter\\t 1—Assessing\\t Risks\\t to\\tGlobal\\t\\nFinancial\\t Stability\\nChapter 1 documents how the crisis is spread -\\ning beyond the U.S. subprime market—namely to \\nthe prime residential and commercial real estate \\nmarkets, consumer credit, and the low- to high-\\ngrade corporate credit markets. The United States \\nremains the epicenter, as the U.S. subprime mar -\\nket was the origin of weakened credit standards \\nand was the first to experience the complications \\narising from the associated structured credit \\nproducts. But financial institutions in other coun -\\ntries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to \\nvarying degree s—weaknesses in risk management \\nsystems and prudential supervision. Industrialized \\ncountries with inflated house price levels relative \\nto fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -\\nhold balance sheets are also at risk.\\nEmerging market countries have been broadly \\nresilient, so far. However, some remain vulner -\\nable to a credit pullback, especially in those \\ncases where domestic credit growth has been \\nfueled from external funding sources and large \\ncurrent account deficits need to be financed. \\nDebt markets, particularly for external corporate \\ndebt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in \\nadvanced countries and costs of funding have \\nrisen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -\\ntite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled \\nout if financial conditions worsen.\\nLosses stemming from credit deterioration \\nand forced sales, as well as reduced earnings \\ngrowth, have significantly tested the balance \\nsheets of both banks and nonbank financial ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxinstitutions. Chapter 1 revisits and extends \\nthe analysis of subprime-related losses in the \\nOctober 2007 GFSR and projects that falling \\nU.S. housing prices  and rising delinquencies \\non mortgage payments  could lead to aggregate \\nlosses related to the residential mortgage market \\nand related securities of about $565 billion, \\nincluding the expected deterioration of prime \\nloans.

Chapter 3 evaluates the success of such \\nefforts, focusing on the actions of the Federal \\nReserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), \\nand the Bank of England. The ability to provide \\nliquidity to a broad array of counterparties using \\na relatively diverse collateral pool aided the \\neffectiveness of the ECB’s liquidity operations. \\nThe Federal Reserve had to alter its procedures \\nto provide liquidity to the banks that needed \\nit and to reduce the stigma attached to the use \\nof the more widely available discount window. \\nThe Term Auction Facility has worked better, \\nand additional facilities have been established \\nrecently to further contain liquidity pressures. \\nChapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the \\neffectiveness of emergency liquidity support and \\nfinds that Federal Reserve and ECB actions were ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -\\nket interest rates, though the impact on spread \\nlevels appears to have been small. \\nConclusions\\t and\\tPolicy\\t Initiatives\\nAlthough the growth and prosperity of recent \\nyears gave ample illustration of the benefits of \\nfinancial innovation, the events of the past eight \\nmonths have also shown that there are costs. \\nCredit risk transfer products—innovations that \\nwere meant to disperse risk broadly—were not \\nalways used to move risk to those best able to \\nbear it. In fact, a surprising amount of risk has \\nreturned to the banking system from where it \\nwas allegedly dispersed. Even though the  GFSR \\nand others warned of higher leverage embed -\\nded in the new structured credit instruments \\nand higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -\\ncial institutions) now appear to be far more \\nleveraged than most had anticipated. As well, \\nregulation and supervision of these new instru -\\nments and techniques did not keep pace. \\nWhat follows are a number of short- and \\nmedium-term recommendations relevant to \\nthe current episode. Several others groups and \\nfora—such as the Financial Stability Forum, the \\nJoint Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking \\nSupervision—are concurrently developing their \\nown detailed standards and guidance, much of \\nwhich is likely to address practical issues at a \\ndeeper level than the recommendations pro -\\nposed below. \\nIn the short term...  \\nThe immediate challenge is to reduce the \\nduration and severity of the crisis. Actions that \\nfocus on reducing uncertainty and strength -\\nening confidence in mature market financial \\nsystems should be the first priority. Some steps \\ncan be accomplished by the private sector \\nwithout the need for formal regulation. Others, \\nwhere the public-good nature of the problem \\nprecludes a purely private solution, will require \\nofficial sector involvement.\\nAreas in which the private sector could use -\\nfully contribute are:• Disclosure. Providing timely and consistent \\nreporting of exposures and valuation meth -\\nods to the public, particularly for structured \\ncredit products and other illiquid assets, will \\nhelp alleviate uncertainties about regulated \\nfinancial institutions’ positions. \\n• Bank balance sheet repair. Writedowns, \\nundertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of \\ntheir size can be established, will help cleanse \\nbanks’ balance sheets. Weakly capitalized insti -\\ntutions should immediately seek to raise fresh \\nequity and medium-term funding even if the \\ncost of doing so appears high. \\n• Overall risk management. Institutions could \\nusefully disclose broad strategies that aim to \\ncorrect the risk management failings that \\nmay have contributed to losses and liquidity \\ndifficulties. Governance structures and the \\nintegration of the management of different \\ntypes of risk across the institution need to be \\nimproved. Counterparty risk management \\nhas also resurfaced as an issue to address. A \\nre-examination of the progress made over \\nthe last decade and gaps that are still present \\n(perhaps inadequate information or risk man -\\nagement structures) will need to be closed.  \\n• Managerial compensation structures.  Incen -\\ntives that may act to shorten the horizon of \\ntop management of deposit-taking financial \\ninstitutions need corrective action. Ideally, \\ncompensation at such regulated financial \\ninstitutions should provide incentives to cor -\\nrect risk management failings early, provide \\nfor adequate capital and liquidity buffers, \\nand generally take decisions that enhance the \\nlong-run viability of the firm so as to lessen \\nsystemic risks.\\nShort-term official sector actions would be \\nmost helpful in the following areas:\\n• Consistency of treatment.  Along with audi -\\ntors, supervisors can encourage transparency \\nand ensure the consistency of approach for \\ndifficult-to-value securities so that account -\\ning and valuation discrepancies across global \\nfinancial institutions are minimized. Supervi -\\nsors should be able to evaluate the robustness \\nof the models used by regulated entities to executive summary\\nxiiivalue securities. Some latitude in the strict \\napplication of fair value accounting during \\nstressful events may need to be more formally \\nrecognized.\\n• More intense supervision.  Supervisors will \\nneed to better assess capital adequacy related \\nto risks that may not be covered in Pillar 1 of \\nthe Basel II framework. More attention could \\nbe paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -\\npriate risk management system (including for \\nmarket and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -\\nnal governance structure. When supervisors \\nare not satisfied that risk is being appropri -\\nately managed or that adequate contingency \\nplans are in place, they should be able to \\ninsist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.\\n• Special stability reports. To help reduce \\nuncertainty and correct negative public \\nmisperceptions, especially in the current \\ncontext of illiquid, hard-to-value structured \\ncredit securities, special stability reports could \\nbe helpful. Such reports could usefully draw \\non relevant supervisory information, assess \\ncurrent risks objectively, and highlight plans \\nto address vulnerabilities in the countries \\ninvolved. \\n• Early action to resolve troubled institutions. \\nThe public sector should proactively stand \\nready to promptly address stress within \\ntroubled financial institutions. In such cases, \\nearly remedial action or intervention may be \\nwarranted.\\n• Public plans for impaired assets.  National \\nauthorities may wish to prepare contingency \\nplans for dealing with large stocks of impaired \\nassets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -\\nics and significant negative effects on the real \\neconomy. The modalities of doing so will dif -\\nfer across countries and sectors, but success -\\nful instances in which fire sales of impaired \\nassets have been prevented could usefully be \\nemulated.\\nFor emerging market countries, policy actions \\nshould focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the \\nknock-on effects from mature markets. Specifi -\\ncally, banks in countries experiencing rapid \\ncredit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency \\nplans to address reductions in such funding. \\nCountries that have relied on external fund -\\ning should expect to see domestic pressures \\ndevelop if international liquidity becomes \\nscarce. Financial market supervisors in locations \\nwhere housing prices have experienced run-\\nups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures \\nwould be handled and whether the legal setting \\nis conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. \\nNearly all emerging market countries should \\nreview the reliability and depth of detail in \\nfinancial institutions’ public disclosures and the \\nrobustness of their accounting frameworks as \\nuncertainty about the health of major financial \\ninstitutions breeds financial instability. Emerg -\\ning market supervisors, regulators, and central \\nbanks should review their own contingency \\nplans—particularly those related to managing \\nliquidity disruptions. Steps should be taken with \\nhome supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate \\nsuch plans and ongoing supervision.\\nIn the medium term... \\nMore fundamental changes are needed over \\nthe medium term. Policymakers should avoid a \\n“rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly \\nstifle innovation or that could exacerbate the \\neffects of the current credit squeeze. Moreover, \\nthe Basel II capital accord, if implemented \\nrigorously, already provides scope for improve -\\nments in the banking area. Nonetheless, there \\nare areas that need further scrutiny, especially \\nas regards structured products and treatment \\nof off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further \\nadjustments to frameworks are needed. \\nGiven their role in the crisis, structured \\nfinance and the originate-to-distribute business \\nmodel of securitization require a careful exami -\\nnation of what needs to be fixed. It is important \\nto note that securitization, per se, was not the \\nproblem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -\\ning standards in the U.S. mortgage market, the \\nconcomitant extension of securitization into \\nincreasingly complex and difficult-to-understand \\nstructures, collateralized by increasingly lower \\nquality assets, and a favorable financial environ -ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxivment in which risks were insufficiently appre -\\nciated. In retrospect, not enough capital was \\nallocated to cover these risks. Although Chap -\\nter 2 does not attempt an exhaustive analysis of \\nthe adverse incentives that led to the extreme \\ngrowth in structured finance underpinning \\nthe crisis, some tentative policies can be put \\nforward.\\nThe private sector could usefully move in the \\nfollowing directions: \\n• Standardization of some components of \\nstructured finance products. This could help \\nincrease market participants’ understand -\\ning of risks, facilitate the development of a \\nsecondary market with more liquidity, and \\nhelp the comparability of valuation. Standard -\\nization could also facilitate the development \\nof a clearinghouse that would mutualize coun -\\nterparty risks associated with these types of \\nover-the-counter products. \\n• Transparency at origination and subsequently. \\nInvestors will be better able to assess the risk \\nof securitized products if they receive more \\ntimely, comprehensible, and adequate infor -\\nmation about the underlying assets and the \\nsensitivity of valuation to various assumptions. \\n• Reform of rating systems. A differentiated \\nrating scale for structured credit products was \\nrecommended in the April 2006 GFSR. Also, \\nadditional information on the vulnerability \\nof structured credit products to downgrades \\nwould need to accompany the new scale for it \\nto be meaningful. This step may require a re-\\nassessment of the regulatory and supervisory \\ntreatment of rated securities. \\n• Transparency and disclosure. Originators \\nshould disclose to their investors relevant \\naggregate information on key risks in off- balance-sheet entities on a timely and regular \\nbasis.  These should include the reliance by \\ninstitutions on credit risk mitigation instru -\\nments such as insurance, and the degree \\nto which the risks reside with the sponsor, \\nparticularly in cases of distress. More gener -\\nally, convergence of disclosure practices (e.g., \\ntiming and content) internationally should be \\nconsidered by standard setters and regulators.The official sector should examine the fol -\\nlowing areas where the application of various \\nstandards may have systemic consequences. \\n• Greater attention to applying fair value \\naccounting results. The prospects of forced \\nsales triggered by fair value below some \\nthreshold will need to be examined thor -\\noughly. Ways of guiding firms to review the \\nelements underlying the valuation without \\nbeing forced to sell would be helpful. The \\nextent to which such fair value “triggers” are \\neither encouraged or mandated in regulation \\nand supervisory guidance would need to be \\nre-evaluated. It is the role of prudential super -\\nvision to judge the reliability of various meth -\\nods used to establish fair values, especially \\nwhen a marked-to-model approach is used. \\nAccounting standard setters will increasingly \\nneed to take into account the financial stabil -\\nity implications in their accounting practices \\nand guidance.\\n• Incentives to set up SIVs and conduits. In \\nprinciple, Basel II provides less incentive than \\nBasel I to transfer risks to such entities for \\nthe purpose of lowering regulatory capital \\ncharges. Nonetheless, a strict implementation \\nof Basel II by national supervisors, possibly \\narmed with stronger guidance regarding \\nconditions for risk transfer and appropriate \\ncapital relief, will be needed. Accounting stan -\\ndards setters, in cooperation with supervisors, \\nshould revisit consolidation rules to address \\nincentives that may encourage a lack of trans -\\nparency regarding off-balance-sheet activities \\nand risks.  \\n• Tighten oversight of mortgage originators.  \\nIn the United States, broadening 2006 and \\n2007 bank guidance notes on good lending \\npractices to cover nonbank mortgage origi -\\nnators should be considered. The efficiency \\nof coordination across banking regulators \\nwould also be enhanced if the fragmentation \\nacross the various regulatory bodies were \\naddressed. Consideration could be given to \\ndevising mechanisms that would leave origi -\\nnators with a financial stake in the loans they \\noriginate. executive summary\\nxvAnother area in which weaknesses contrib -\\nuted to the crisis is financial institutions’ liquid -\\nity management. It is now obvious that various \\nfactors may have encouraged financial institu -\\ntions to insufficiently protect themselves against \\nan adverse liquidity event—a situation that \\nneeds to be addressed.\\nFor financial institutions, the crisis has pro -\\nvided many important lessons including those \\ninvolving:\\n• Liquidity risk management. Firms will need to \\nfactor in more severe price jumps (“gapping”) \\nand correlation movements in their market \\nrisk models, employing adjustments to risk \\nmeasures where possible. Better stress tests \\ncould be undertaken with longer periods of \\nfunding illiquidity and improved contingency \\nplans. More transparency regarding how \\nliquidity risk is managed within the firm could \\nbe available to investors.\\n• More realistic assumptions about the liquidity \\nof complex structured securities. Firms’ reli -\\nance on highly structured securities to gener -\\nate collateral proved problematic during the \\ncrisis. Greater availability on balance sheets of \\nhighly liquid assets to use as collateral could \\nallow institutions easier access to funding \\nsources during periods of stress.\\nFinancial regulators and supervisory authori -\\nties also need to take a more active role in \\nreviewing liquidity management issues and \\nsupervisory guidance, and considering other \\nregulatory improvements.• \\nStrengthen existing international liquidity \\nguidance. The Basel Committee’s Working \\nGroup on Liquidity is already considering \\nhow to strengthen its existing guidance in this \\narea, and prompt review would be welcome. \\nThe use of multiple currencies for funding \\nglobally active banks suggests that a more uni -\\nfied approach to liquidity management across \\ncountries may be needed. \\n• Monitoring best practices. A better method \\nof monitoring progress toward achieving \\n“best practices” for liquidity management \\n(e.g., those of the Basel Committee, the Joint \\nForum, and the Institute of International Finance) could help prevent gaps across \\ninstitutions. If progress is insufficient, a  Pillar 2-like system may be needed, whereby \\nsupervisors are tasked with ensuring that \\nadequate bank liquidity management systems \\nare in place and that banks hold sufficient \\nliquidity buffers and have well-formulated \\ncontingency plans.\\nMonetary authorities as well need to review \\ntheir operational practices in light of the crisis. \\nThis event has required unprecedented liquidity \\ninfusions to the interbank market and the use \\nof operational instruments that had not been \\nused before. Central banks should now converge \\nto policies that have worked during the crisis to \\nimprove the functioning of interbank markets \\nand better distribute liquidity. Such policies to \\nbe considered are the following :\\n• Broader range of collateral. To be expedi -\\nent, central banks need to be able to oper -\\nate with a wide range of collateral, perhaps \\nagreeing on collateral that could be posted \\nat multiple central banks. However, central \\nbanks will need to have a well-established \\ncollateral pricing policy to avoid taking \\nundue credit and liquidity risks onto their \\nown balance sheets.\\n• Wide group of counterparties.  Central banks \\nshould have a wide group of counterparty \\nbanks established during normal times that \\nare eligible to receive liquidity during stressful \\ntimes. Altering this group during periods of \\nstress can signal that certain banks, with per -\\nhaps newly acceptable collateral, are receiving \\npreferential treatment.\\n• Maturity structure of liquidity provision. \\nOperational procedures enabling the provi -\\nsion of liquidity at different maturities can be \\nhelpful. However, altering the maturity profile \\nof the central bank’s balance sheet needs to \\nbe accompanied by communication indicat -\\ning how this is consistent with the monetary \\npolicy strategy.\\n• Better coordination among financial over -\\nseers.  Central banks and others with over -\\nsight over financial institutions could usefully \\ndevelop closer ties and improved information ExECUTIVE\\t SUMMAR y\\nxvisharing so as to better anticipate liquidity and \\nsolvency difficulties. Central banks should \\nensure that they have continuous access to \\nindividual bank information so as to be able \\nto independently judge the health of poten -\\ntial counterparties. \\n• Supervising responsibility and enforcement. \\nSupervisors must be provided with sufficient \\nlegal powers and resources. For example, \\nif institutions answer to multiple regulators \\nand supervisors, the scope for ambiguity and \\narbitrage is magnified. Therefore, it would \\nbe preferable if supervisory and enforcement \\nresponsibilities for a single institution were \\nto be vested in a single agency. Cross-border \\ninformation sharing and coordination among \\nsuch bodies should also be strengthened.In sum, there are a number of areas that \\nrequire increased attention by private market \\nparticipants and the public sector. For its part, \\nthere is room for the International Monetary \\nFund to more actively promote best practices \\nfor financial crisis and central bank liquidity \\nmanagement. These issues are covered in IMF \\nFinancial Sector Assessment Programs, and even \\ngreater efforts will be made to apply them in the \\nIMF’s bilateral and multilateral policy advice. \\nAs the crisis is still unfolding, lessons are as \\nyet incomplete. Nonetheless, some issues need \\nto be addressed urgently—shoring up the confi -\\ndence in financial institutions should be a prior -\\nity. Other issues will require more reflection \\nand study so as to minimize unintended conse -\\nquences of regulations or supervisory practices.'],\n",

The uncertainty about where \\noff- balance-sheet bank exposures will materialize \\nnext has led to a tiering of interbank lending rates. Banks that are believed to either have structured credit product losses, or that need to satisfy contingent credit lines to their con-duits or special purpose vehicles, face higher \\ninterbank rates. In some cases, the ﬂ  ows in the \\ninterbank market are stymied by some large banks’ desire to hold onto liquidity in case they need to ﬁ  nance other activities, such as the large \\npipeline of leveraged buyouts scheduled for the remainder of the year. Overall, there has been a sharp rise in perceived counterparty risk, and a desire to keep the additional liquidity on hand, at least for now.\\nThe April 2007 GFSR ﬂ  agged the underlying \\ncauses of the current correction. The weakening of credit discipline and the potential compla-\\ncency, which were highlighted in that edition, led to a buildup of credit risks in the U.S. mortgage market, leveraged buyout market, and \\nsome lending to emerging markets. The benign \\neconomic and ﬁ  nancial conditions of recent \\nyears weakened incentives to conduct due dili-gence on borrowers and counterparties. More-\\nover the “originate and distribute” model used \\nfor credit products by many ﬁ  nancial institutions \\nmeant that many such institutions could choose not to hold the credit risk they originated, reducing their incentives to monitor borrowers. \\nInvestors in the distributed securities may have \\nrelaxed their due diligence in assessing liquidity and leverage risks or chosen to rely excessively on ratings agencies to analyze risks in complex ﬁ nancial instruments. Stress in the U.S. housing \\nmarket then weakened mortgage-backed securi-\\nties, an  important component of the global ﬁ nancial system. The resulting multiple credit \\ndowngrades of these securities by ratings agen-cies led to downward pressure on their prices \\nand started to deepen the repricing episode that \\nbegan some time ago.\\nLeverage has played a key role in amplifying \\nthe disturbances. The ease with which some banks and other investment vehicles, includ-\\ning hedge funds, were able to borrow against difﬁ cult-to-price collateral traded in illiquid \\nmarkets severely aggravated conditions when market liquidity evaporated, resulting in a process of forced deleveraging at “ﬁ  re sale” prices and \\nthe failure of some funds. Institutions that have \\nsuffered the most have had strategies that were based on high levels of leverage and had assumed continued liquidity in secondary markets.\\nA long period of abnormally low market \\nvolatility likely exacerbated the episode. Risk \\npremia in many markets had fallen to histori-cally low levels as more and more investors bet on a continuation of the benign, low-volatility environment. Returns became more correlated. \\nAs markets fell, risk premia expanded quickly. \\nSimilar risk management techniques, common investors, and similar positions may have exac-erbated the situation. Losses were magniﬁ  ed as \\nmany market participants tried to exit similar \\npositions simultaneously.\\nChapter 1 of this report summarizes the over-\\nall assessment of stability using the global ﬁ  nan-\\ncial stability map introduced in the April 2007 GFSR. Extending the work in the last GFSR, the \\nchapter focuses on the fallout from weakening \\ncredit discipline in the U.S. nonprime mort-gage market and the leveraged buyout market (including the market turbulence of August 2007, which resulted in a drying up of term \\nlending in money markets), and details linkages \\nacross markets. The chapter explains how volatil-ity has been ampliﬁ  ed by high leverage and how \\nrisks are transmitted between institutions. It\\ngathers evidence on where the risks now reside, and what might be the impact on banks, corpo-\\nrations, and households as losses surface.  \\nThe chapter also examines the global aspects \\nof the lack of credit discipline. Overall, emerg-ing market risks remain ﬁ  nely balanced, with \\nmany countries beneﬁ  ting from improved \\nmacroeconomic fundamentals and better poli-\\ncymaking frameworks. External sovereign debt has been reduced and debt structures are better managed.

However, given the volume and complexity of the information that could potentially be provided, and the cost of providing it, it will be important to carefully \\nconsider the appropriate amount and type of \\ndisclosure needed to alleviate the problems evident in this episode.\\nSecond, while securitization, and ﬁ  nancial \\ninnovation more generally, through enhanced \\nrisk distribution have made markets more efﬁ  -\\ncient, there is a need to understand how they may have contributed to the current situation. In particular, it is important to consider the extent to which the incentive structure, in the \\ncontext of very benign times, may have diluted \\nthe incentives for originating lenders to monitor risk. In the U.S. mortgage market, the public sector costs associated with the lack of supervi-sory oversight of some mortgage originators will \\nneed to be balanced against the improved access \\nto credit that some households received. Gener-ally, the relationship between checks and bal-ances throughout the supply chain of structured \\nproducts may require some rethinking.\\nThird, there is a need to examine risk analysis \\nof credit derivatives and structured products and the role of ratings agencies. Ratings and ratings agencies will continue to be a fundamental com-\\nponent in the functioning of ﬁ  nancial markets. \\nHowever, there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive \\nthe same ratings. Ratings of complex structured \\nproducts may have become too connected to  ixix\\nSince the April 2007 Global Financial Stabil-\\nity Report  (GFSR), global ﬁ  nancial stabil-\\nity has endured an important test. Credit \\nand market risks have risen and markets have \\nbecome more volatile. Markets are recognizing the extent to which credit discipline has dete-riorated in recent years—most notably in the U.S. nonprime mortgage and leveraged loan markets, but also in other related credit markets. \\nThis has prompted a retrenchment from some \\nrisky assets and deleveraging, causing a widening of credit spreads in riskier asset classes and more volatile bond and equity markets. The absence of prices and secondary markets for some struc-\\ntured credit products, and concerns about the \\nlocation and size of potential losses, has led to disruptions in some money markets and funding difﬁ culties for a number of ﬁ  nancial institutions, \\nas some counterparties have been reluctant to \\nextend credit to those thought to hold lower quality, illiquid assets. The resulting disruption has required extraordinary liquidity injections by a number of central banks to facilitate the \\norderly functioning of these markets.\\nThe potential consequences of this episode \\nshould not be underestimated and the adjust-ment process is likely to be protracted. Credit conditions may not normalize soon, and some \\nof the practices that have developed in the \\nstructured credit markets will have to change. At the same time, the global economy entered this turbulent period exhibiting solid growth, \\nespecially in emerging market countries. Sys-\\ntemically important ﬁ  nancial institutions began \\nthis episode with adequate capital to manage the likely level of credit losses. So far, despite the signiﬁ  cant ongoing correction in ﬁ  nancial mar-\\nkets, global growth remains solid, though some \\nslowdown could be expected. Downside risks \\nhave increased signiﬁ  cantly and, even if those \\nrisks fail to materialize, the implications of this period of turbulence will be signiﬁ  cant and far reaching. Eventually, lessons for both the private \\nsector and the regulatory and supervisory arenas will have to be drawn in order to strengthen the ﬁ nancial system against future strains.\\nThe threat to ﬁ  nancial stability increased as \\nthe uncertainty became manifest in the money \\nmarkets that provide short-term ﬁ  nancing (espe-\\ncially commercial paper markets). At the center of the turmoil is a funding mismatch whereby medium-term, illiquid, and hard-to-value assets, \\nsuch as structured credit securities, were being \\nfunded by very short-term money market securities—often asset-backed commercial paper. The market illiquidity and the difﬁ  culty in valu-\\ning the complex, structured products held as \\nassets has compounded the risks of the fund-\\ning mismatch. Thus, while potentially helping protect the ﬁ  nancial system from concentrations \\nof credit risk in banks, the dispersal of struc-tured credit products has substantially increased \\nuncertainty about the extent of the risks and \\nwhere they are ultimately held.\\nThis funding mismatch was undertaken by \\na signiﬁ  cant number of conduits and special \\npurpose vehicles that had assumed they could \\nhold their illiquid assets to maturity. Many have been associated with regulated banks, and to a large extent their funding strategies were backed by contingent liquidity lines from those \\nbanks. When doubts about the quality of some \\nof the underlying assets emerged and the high ratings were perceived as less reliable, prices of the assets fell, the rollover of associated asset-backed commercial paper became very \\ndifﬁ cult, and funding began to be squeezed. \\nAs a consequence, what had been contingent, off-balance-sheet liabilities for regulated banks threatened to move “on balance sheet.” The funding difﬁ  culties were ﬁ  rst felt in Europe and, \\nsubsequently, in a number of other places. The \\nrapid transmission of disturbances in one part of the ﬁ  nancial system to other parts, sometimes EXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxthrough opaque and intertwined channels, has \\nsurprised both market participants and the ofﬁ cial sector. The uncertainty about where \\noff- balance-sheet bank exposures will materialize \\nnext has led to a tiering of interbank lending rates. Banks that are believed to either have structured credit product losses, or that need to satisfy contingent credit lines to their con-duits or special purpose vehicles, face higher \\ninterbank rates.

Ratings and ratings agencies will continue to be a fundamental com-\\nponent in the functioning of ﬁ  nancial markets. \\nHowever, there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive \\nthe same ratings. Ratings of complex structured \\nproducts may have become too connected to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiifacilitating origination. In periods of turbulence, \\nthe rapid downgrades then raise questions about the reliability of these ratings and their useful-\\nness for the investors. We repeat the call from \\nthe April 2006 GFSR for a more differentiated scale of ratings for structured products. Inves-tors also have an obligation and responsibility to understand the dynamics and liquidity risks asso-ciated with the products they buy—they wrongly \\nassumed that a low probability of default meant a low likelihood of losses from market move-\\nments. In the case of complex structured credit products, investors need to look behind the ratings—they should not assume that the simple \\nletter ratings provided by ratings agencies show \\nequivalent risks as those for other asset classes. Differentiation and transparency in the underly-ing assumptions and construction of the various structures would facilitate appropriate due \\ndiligence by investors.\\nFourth, the valuation of complex products in \\nthe context of a market where liquidity is insuf-ﬁ cient to provide reliable market prices requires \\nmore consideration. When purchasing complex products, investors will need to consider the asso-ciated liquidity aspects and include an appropri-ate liquidity risk “premium” as part of the price. Financial institutions holding such securities \\nas collateral will need to assign a “haircut” that \\nfactors in liquidity characteristics. Importantly, ﬁ nancial institutions need to make sure that \\nthey have robust funding strategies appropriately suited for their business model and that such funding strategies can accommodate stressful conditions. More generally, the rapid growth of some illiquid instruments raises questions about whether originators of such securities should be expected to provide secondary markets to con-\\ntribute to the valuation process.\\nFifth, the relevant perimeter of risk consoli-\\ndation for banks has proved to be larger than the usual accounting or legal perimeters. There are two notable examples: (1) reputational risk \\nmay force banks to internalize losses of legally \\nindependent entities; and (2) new instruments or structures may mask off-balance-sheet or contingent liabilities. The result is that risks that appear to have been distributed may yet return \\nin various forms to the banks that distributed them. The relevant perimeter is not only an issue for supervisors, but also for the ﬁ  nancial \\ninstitutions themselves—their risk management systems, audit processes and internal oversight \\nand governance structures.\\nPolicymakers now face a delicate balancing \\nact. They must establish frameworks that encour-age investors to maintain high credit standards and strengthen risk management systems in \\ngood times as well as bad. Actions should only be \\nundertaken if the public policy beneﬁ  ts outweigh \\nthe costs, taking care to thoroughly examine pos-sible unintended consequences. In general, the current regulatory systems have proven resilient \\nto date, and regulators must be continually mind-\\nful that households and ﬁ  rms have beneﬁ  ted \\ngreatly from the ﬁ  nancial innovation and solid \\ngrowth and ﬁ  nancial stability of recent years.\\n* * *\\nChapters 2 and 3 examine two respective \\nissues that are the outcome of the lengthy period of low mature market yields and unusu-ally low ﬁ  nancial market volatility over the last \\nseveral years. Chapter 2 examines the extent \\nto which market risk management methods may have encouraged more risk-taking during this relatively benign period, perhaps resulting \\nin a more rapid withdrawal from risky assets \\nthan would otherwise be the case as conditions change. In light of rapid capital ﬂ  ows to emerg-\\ning market countries, Chapter 3 investigates how countries can best deal with capital ﬂ  ow volatility \\nin the medium term by improving the depth, \\nliquidity, and institutional quality of their domes-tic ﬁ nancial markets.\\nChapter 2 speciﬁ  cally examines market risk \\nmanagement techniques to see whether their \\ncommon usage, while seemingly prudent for \\nindividual institutions, could exacerbate mar-ket volatility during periods of stressful market conditions. The question is examined in two ways. The ﬁ  rst is by using a stylized version of \\nthe most common market risk model, value-at-\\nrisk (VaR), which is the estimated loss a ﬁ  rm is  ixix\\nSince the April 2007 Global Financial Stabil-\\nity Report  (GFSR), global ﬁ  nancial stabil-\\nity has endured an important test.

Ratings and ratings agencies will continue to be a fundamental com-\\nponent in the functioning of ﬁ  nancial markets. \\nHowever, there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive \\nthe same ratings. Ratings of complex structured \\nproducts may have become too connected to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiifacilitating origination. In periods of turbulence, \\nthe rapid downgrades then raise questions about the reliability of these ratings and their useful-\\nness for the investors. We repeat the call from \\nthe April 2006 GFSR for a more differentiated scale of ratings for structured products. Inves-tors also have an obligation and responsibility to understand the dynamics and liquidity risks asso-ciated with the products they buy—they wrongly \\nassumed that a low probability of default meant a low likelihood of losses from market move-\\nments. In the case of complex structured credit products, investors need to look behind the ratings—they should not assume that the simple \\nletter ratings provided by ratings agencies show \\nequivalent risks as those for other asset classes. Differentiation and transparency in the underly-ing assumptions and construction of the various structures would facilitate appropriate due \\ndiligence by investors.\\nFourth, the valuation of complex products in \\nthe context of a market where liquidity is insuf-ﬁ cient to provide reliable market prices requires \\nmore consideration. When purchasing complex products, investors will need to consider the asso-ciated liquidity aspects and include an appropri-ate liquidity risk “premium” as part of the price. Financial institutions holding such securities \\nas collateral will need to assign a “haircut” that \\nfactors in liquidity characteristics. Importantly, ﬁ nancial institutions need to make sure that \\nthey have robust funding strategies appropriately suited for their business model and that such funding strategies can accommodate stressful conditions. More generally, the rapid growth of some illiquid instruments raises questions about whether originators of such securities should be expected to provide secondary markets to con-\\ntribute to the valuation process.\\nFifth, the relevant perimeter of risk consoli-\\ndation for banks has proved to be larger than the usual accounting or legal perimeters. There are two notable examples: (1) reputational risk \\nmay force banks to internalize losses of legally \\nindependent entities; and (2) new instruments or structures may mask off-balance-sheet or contingent liabilities. The result is that risks that appear to have been distributed may yet return \\nin various forms to the banks that distributed them. The relevant perimeter is not only an issue for supervisors, but also for the ﬁ  nancial \\ninstitutions themselves—their risk management systems, audit processes and internal oversight \\nand governance structures.\\nPolicymakers now face a delicate balancing \\nact. They must establish frameworks that encour-age investors to maintain high credit standards and strengthen risk management systems in \\ngood times as well as bad. Actions should only be \\nundertaken if the public policy beneﬁ  ts outweigh \\nthe costs, taking care to thoroughly examine pos-sible unintended consequences. In general, the current regulatory systems have proven resilient \\nto date, and regulators must be continually mind-\\nful that households and ﬁ  rms have beneﬁ  ted \\ngreatly from the ﬁ  nancial innovation and solid \\ngrowth and ﬁ  nancial stability of recent years.\\n* * *\\nChapters 2 and 3 examine two respective \\nissues that are the outcome of the lengthy period of low mature market yields and unusu-ally low ﬁ  nancial market volatility over the last \\nseveral years. Chapter 2 examines the extent \\nto which market risk management methods may have encouraged more risk-taking during this relatively benign period, perhaps resulting \\nin a more rapid withdrawal from risky assets \\nthan would otherwise be the case as conditions change. In light of rapid capital ﬂ  ows to emerg-\\ning market countries, Chapter 3 investigates how countries can best deal with capital ﬂ  ow volatility \\nin the medium term by improving the depth, \\nliquidity, and institutional quality of their domes-tic ﬁ nancial markets.\\nChapter 2 speciﬁ  cally examines market risk \\nmanagement techniques to see whether their \\ncommon usage, while seemingly prudent for \\nindividual institutions, could exacerbate mar-ket volatility during periods of stressful market conditions. The question is examined in two ways. The ﬁ  rst is by using a stylized version of \\nthe most common market risk model, value-at-\\nrisk (VaR), which is the estimated loss a ﬁ  rm is EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxiiiunlikely to exceed at a given degree of conﬁ  -\\ndence. For instance, a ﬁ  rm’s one-day estimated \\nVaR of $10 million at a conﬁ  dence level of 95 \\npercent implies that the ﬁ  rm would expect to \\nlose more than $10 million on its portfolio only ﬁ ve days out of 100. A stylized model is used to \\ndemonstrate how VaR declines during a lower volatility environment, but rises when higher volatility returns. The stylized portfolios are then “stressed” by examining how VaR would respond with data from previous episodes of ﬁ  nancial \\nmarket turbulence. Lastly, simulations are con-ducted in which several ﬁ  rms are hypothesized \\nto use the same, or slightly different, VaR mod-els, also during periods of stress. Results suggest that such ﬁ  rms, acting according to their own \\nmodels to contain risks, could collectively make markets more volatile, especially if risk aversion is low. The simulations also show, however, that a greater diversity of models would help to reduce such potential instability.\\nChapter 2 also examines risk management \\nprocedures of investment banks and hedge funds to see whether they conform to the pre-\\nconditions necessary to amplify market volatil-\\nity in practice. While all ﬁ  rms maintain that \\nthey would not rigidly follow their VaR models in stressful circumstances, there are a number \\nof ways in which VaR metrics, or related risk \\nlimits, could act to amplify market volatility. In fact, recent turbulence suggests some of these techniques may be contributing to the current turbulent conditions to some degree. Overall, \\nVaR and other risk management techniques \\nwill encourage ﬁ  nancial institutions to respond \\nmore rapidly to changes in risk. Normally, this will facilitate early detection and prompt cor-rection of risks deemed excessive by the institu-\\ntion. However, the use of similar techniques \\nacross institutions during periods of stress can lead to larger price movements than would occur if different techniques were used. It is thus worthwhile for regulators and supervi-\\nsors to acknowledge the beneﬁ  ts of discretion \\nwhen implementing risk management systems (including new ways to incorporate credit and liquidity risks) and to promote the use of “stress testing”—encouraging all ﬁ  rms to consider \\ntheir interactive effects during periods of stress, as some do already. A diversity of investment positions and types of participants is even more important to help stabilize markets. Regulators and supervisors would also do well to consider \\nmore concretely than they do now how they \\nwould respond to the amplifying effects when individual ﬁ  rms naturally attempt to protect \\ntheir ﬁ  rm’s franchise value.\\nChapter 3 empirically analyzes a common \\nview—whether, in addition to strong macro-\\neconomic fundamentals, a well-functioning domestic ﬁ  nancial market encourages capital \\ninﬂ ows and reduces their volatility over the \\nmedium term. A panel estimation technique is \\nused to examine the factors that determine the \\nvolume and volatility of annual capital inﬂ  ows \\nfor a sample of developed and emerging market economies from 1977 to 2006. The factors include ﬁ  nancial variables such as equity market \\ndepth and liquidity and ﬁ  nancial openness, \\nand a shorter sample also includes institutional quality variables such as corporate governance quality and accounting standards. The results of the empirical work show that the liquidity of \\nequity markets and ﬁ  nancial openness positively \\ninﬂ uence the level of capital inﬂ  ows. Moreover, \\nthe panel estimations show that more ﬁ  nancial \\nopenness reduces the volatility of inﬂ  ows. Sepa-\\nrately, the chapter shows that improvements in \\na broad set of institutional quality variables are \\ncorrelated with lower volatility. \\nChapter 3 also examines how ﬁ  ve emerging \\nmarket countries have coped with the recent rise \\nin capital inﬂ  ows and discusses some of their pol-\\nicy options. These ﬁ  ve country examples reveal \\nthe difﬁ  culty of ﬁ  nding a common set of ﬁ  nancial \\npolicies that help deal with capital inﬂ  ows. Gener-\\nally, policies that encourage ﬁ  nancial market \\ndevelopment over the medium term—including \\na well-regulated system, better transparency and broader institutional quality, and improved risk management for ﬁ  nancial institutions—will likely \\ncushion the ﬁ  nancial system from the potentially \\ndestabilizing effects of abrupt capital outﬂ  ows \\nbetter than will short-term ﬁ  xes.'],\n",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxAgainst the backdrop of continued global \\ngrowth, none of the individually identiﬁed risks by themselves threaten ﬁnancial stability. How-ever, with volatility across asset classes close to historic lows and spreads on a variety of credit instruments tight, investors may not have ade-quately factored in the possibility that a “volatil-ity shock” may be ampliﬁed given the increased linkages across products and markets. Institu-tions may well be acting in accordance with their own incentives, but collectively their behavior may cause a buildup of investment positions in certain markets, possibly resulting in a disor-derly correction when conditions change. For instance, the rapid growth of some innovative instruments, the rise in leverage in parts of the ﬁnancial system, and the growth of carry trades suggest that market participants are expecting a continuation of the low volatility environment and that a sustained rise in volatility could per-turb a wide range of markets.\\nChapter II examines the recent acceleration \\nin the accumulation of international assets as well as the investors behind rising cross-border ﬂows. As noted above, ﬂows and stocks of cross-border claims have increased both in absolute size and relative to the volume of domestic economic activity. The diversity of assets, source countries, and investor types now involved in cross-border asset accumulation suggests more stable ﬂows. However, for some countries, the sharp increase in capital inﬂows has contributed to rapid credit growth and asset price inﬂa-tion, at times complicating the conduct of poli-cies. Furthermore, foreign investors have been venturing into markets previously regarded as excessively risky for outsiders, encouraged by the generally benign ﬁnancial environment. \\nPolicymakers can take advantage of these \\nsecular changes and at the same time minimize pockets of vulnerabilities that have become apparent. Recipient countries have to con-tinue to establish a track record of credible macroeconomic policies. Vulnerabilities can be \\nreduced by promoting efﬁciency, stability, and the effective regulation of domestic capital mar-kets (including the development of local debt markets) so as to increase their attractiveness to a stable investor base. Liberalization of capital outﬂows from domestic investors, though not a panacea, may help balance the effects of capital inﬂows and allow domestic investors to better manage their risk.\\nChapter III examines the implications of \\nthe accelerating globalization of ﬁnancial \\ninstitutions––particularly banks––for global \\nﬁnancial stability. The institutional and regional \\npattern of globalization is remarkably varied. For large banks, greater geographical disper-sion of assets and revenues tends to be associ-ated with better share price performance and lower default risks. However, while cross-border diversiﬁcation seems to be associated positively with the stability of the individual institution, the ﬁnancial system as a whole may not be more stable, with the potential for linkages among markets and activities having increased. This is an especially important result for countries in regions with heavy foreign bank penetration across correlated economies.\\nThe chapter highlights two clear priorities \\nto help to contain the potential contagion risk arising from institutional globalization while maximizing its beneﬁts. First, supervisors need to collaborate ever more closely in the oversight of cross-border institutions. Second, authorities need to continue improving crisis management procedures with the counterparts with whom they share the greatest overlapping responsi-bilities and interests. While the jurisdiction of supervisors and regulators remains predomi-nantly domestic, at odds with the scope of activi-ties of global institutions, these practical steps can go some way toward addressing the chal-lenges to ﬁnancial stability posed by institutional globalization.'],\n",

However, \\nstructural improvements in financial markets \\nelsewhere could influence the future relative \\nterms for cross-border capital flows, by boost -\\ning these markets’ attractiveness to investors \\nrelative to U.S. markets. In addition, as interna -\\ntional reserve holdings continue to set record \\nhighs, it is possible that portfolio choices of \\nreserve managers could shift away (at least in \\nrelative terms) from  traditional high-liquidity, \\nlow-risk instruments .\\nIn this respect, the future demand for U.S. \\nassets is also likely to be affected by the broad \\ntrend toward liberalization and diversifica -\\ntion of capital outflows in Asia, a region whose \\nauthorities hold more than half the world’s net \\ninternational reserves (see Annex 1.5). It will \\ndepend increasingly on the portfolio alloca -\\ntion choices of oil-producing nations, which \\nhave amassed substantial reserves in the last \\ntwo years or so. Accordingly, while relative \\nprice adjustments between asset classes are \\nlikely to be smooth, there may be some shift \\nin demand away from the highly liquid, short-\\nduration, fixed-income assets typically held in \\nofficial reserves portfolios. Over the longer run, \\nwhen portfolios adjust fully and have exploited \\ndiversification and growth opportunities, net \\nforeign asset positions will likely stabilize, and \\nglobal imbalances will decline to more sustain -\\nable levels .\\nStill, during this transition, there remains a \\nrisk that a dollar decline could become disor -\\nderly. Data on foreign holdings of U.S. securi -\\nties show that foreign investors’ exposures to \\nlosses from a dollar decline are potentially \\nlarge and, importantly, continue to increase. \\nAlthough the baseline market view is that dol -\\nlar adjustment will remain orderly, the risks of \\na disorderly adjustment would be reduced by \\nappropriate policy actions by the authorities \\nin countries that are the main counterparts to global current account imbalances .Growth\\t in\\temerging\\t Market\\t\\nHousehold\\tCredit\\nHousehold credit is growing rapidly, albeit \\nfrom a low base, across many EM countries. \\nChapter II—which assesses recent trends in \\nhousehold credit—argues that greater access \\nto credit helps smooth household consump -\\ntion, improves investment opportunities, eases \\nconstraints on small and family-owned busi -\\nnesses, and diversifies assets held by household \\nand financial institutions. However, a rapid \\nincrease in household credit, without adequate \\nrisk management and prudential infrastruc -\\nture, can weaken household balance sheets, \\ncontribute to asset price bubbles and deteriora -\\ntion of external current account, and create \\nvulnerabilities for financial systems in some EM countries .\\nIn most EM countries, retail credit expand -\\ning from relatively low levels—compared with \\nmore developed countries—is desirable and \\ndoes not pose a direct threat to financial stabil -\\nity.

Under \\nmore adverse circumstances, the weaknesses in \\nhousehold balance sheets could increase stress \\non the financial sector, weaken property prices, \\nand slow down consumption spending. There \\nare also important localized concerns.

In addition, as interna -\\ntional reserve holdings continue to set record \\nhighs, it is possible that portfolio choices of \\nreserve managers could shift away (at least in \\nrelative terms) from  traditional high-liquidity, \\nlow-risk instruments .\\nIn this respect, the future demand for U.S. \\nassets is also likely to be affected by the broad \\ntrend toward liberalization and diversifica -\\ntion of capital outflows in Asia, a region whose \\nauthorities hold more than half the world’s net \\ninternational reserves (see Annex 1.5). It will \\ndepend increasingly on the portfolio alloca -\\ntion choices of oil-producing nations, which \\nhave amassed substantial reserves in the last \\ntwo years or so. Accordingly, while relative \\nprice adjustments between asset classes are \\nlikely to be smooth, there may be some shift \\nin demand away from the highly liquid, short-\\nduration, fixed-income assets typically held in \\nofficial reserves portfolios. Over the longer run, \\nwhen portfolios adjust fully and have exploited \\ndiversification and growth opportunities, net \\nforeign asset positions will likely stabilize, and \\nglobal imbalances will decline to more sustain -\\nable levels .\\nStill, during this transition, there remains a \\nrisk that a dollar decline could become disor -\\nderly. Data on foreign holdings of U.S. securi -\\nties show that foreign investors’ exposures to \\nlosses from a dollar decline are potentially \\nlarge and, importantly, continue to increase. \\nAlthough the baseline market view is that dol -\\nlar adjustment will remain orderly, the risks of \\na disorderly adjustment would be reduced by \\nappropriate policy actions by the authorities \\nin countries that are the main counterparts to global current account imbalances .Growth\\t in\\temerging\\t Market\\t\\nHousehold\\tCredit\\nHousehold credit is growing rapidly, albeit \\nfrom a low base, across many EM countries. \\nChapter II—which assesses recent trends in \\nhousehold credit—argues that greater access \\nto credit helps smooth household consump -\\ntion, improves investment opportunities, eases \\nconstraints on small and family-owned busi -\\nnesses, and diversifies assets held by household \\nand financial institutions. However, a rapid \\nincrease in household credit, without adequate \\nrisk management and prudential infrastruc -\\nture, can weaken household balance sheets, \\ncontribute to asset price bubbles and deteriora -\\ntion of external current account, and create \\nvulnerabilities for financial systems in some EM countries .\\nIn most EM countries, retail credit expand -\\ning from relatively low levels—compared with \\nmore developed countries—is desirable and \\ndoes not pose a direct threat to financial stabil -\\nity. However, household credit has grown in EM \\ncountries during a period of low mature mar -\\nket interest rates and falling EM interest rates; \\nthus household balance sheets may come under \\npressure as these conditions reverse. Under \\nmore adverse circumstances, the weaknesses in \\nhousehold balance sheets could increase stress \\non the financial sector, weaken property prices, \\nand slow down consumption spending. There \\nare also important localized concerns. For \\nexample, in some emerging European econo -\\nmies, credit-driven consumption has led to a \\ndeterioration of external balances, with house -\\nhold borrowers exposed to potentially large \\ninterest and exchange rate risks and declining house prices .\\nEM policymakers can take several steps to \\nprevent or mitigate risks associated with a \\nbuildup in household credit. These include \\nadopting prudent macroeconomic management \\nthat can help lower the risk of large shocks to \\nhousehold incomes, exchange rates, or inter -\\nest rates; introducing sound prudential norms \\nfor household credit and encouraging good \\norigination standards and information sharing executive summary\\n\\x18executive summary\\n\\x18iby banks; and developing the necessary legal \\nand regulatory framework and infrastructure. \\nWhile EM countries have made improvements \\nin recent years, substantial progress remains to be made in all three areas. These measures will \\nallow EMs to reap the substantial benefits of \\ndeveloping this market, while avoiding boom-\\nbust cycles during the formative years .'],\n",

Analysis presented in this report suggests that in order to restore market confidence and reduce excessive reliance on central bank funding, considerable further strengthening of euro area bank balance sheets will be needed. This will require higher capital levels, if a detrimental xii International Monetary Fund | April 2011process of deleveraging is to be avoided, and a set \\nof mostly smaller banks will have to be restructured and, where necessary, resolved. In the United States, a lackluster housing market, legacy mortgage problems, and a backlog of foreclosures continue to put pres-\\nsure on the banking system, limiting credit creation \\nand a return to a fully functioning mortgage market. Larger bank capital buffers and strengthened balance sheets will also be necessary as countries transition to a new and more demanding regulatory regime. \\nCountries in which banking systems are still strug-\\ngling should enhance transparency (including through more rigorous and realistic stress tests) and recapitalize, restructure, and (if necessary) close weak institutions. Without these longer-term financial sector reforms, short-term funding difficulties may escalate into another systemic liquidity event. \\nMeasuring and mitigating systemic liquidity risks \\nshould be at the forefront of the agenda of policymak-ers. Those risks were a main feature of the latest crisis and have yet to be addressed. Chapter 2 takes a close \\nlook at this topic, examining the role that Basel III \\nliquidity requirements will play when they are intro-duced. The analysis suggests that, while helping to raise liquidity buffers, Basel III will be unable to fully address the systemic nature of liquidity risk. The chap-ter provides some illustrative techniques for measuring systemic liquidity risk and firms’ contribution to it, and suggests some accompanying macroprudential tools that could, after further refinement and testing, be used to mitigate such risks. For instance, one of the approaches provides a way to gauge, based on a firm’s assets and liabilities and its interbank connections, the higher capital needed to ensure that its risk of insolvency does not cause a destabilizing liquidity run \\nduring stressful periods. Tools of this type would allow \\nfor more effective sharing of the private-public burden of systemic liquidity risk and help reduce central bank interventions during periods of stress.\\nA common feature of the crisis in many coun-\\ntries was excessive and misallocated credit growth, which helped fuel housing market booms. Chapter 3 examines the connections between the housing finance systems and financial stability, noting that the structure of some countries’ housing finance systems led to a deeper housing bust and financial instability. The chapter suggests a set of best practices for hous-ing finance. For the United States, where the housing market and its financing are still problematic, these best practices imply that there should be better-defined and more transparent government participa-\\ntion in the housing market, including a diminished \\nrole of the two large government-sponsored entities (Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae). These goals will need to be pursued incrementally, while taking into account the still-weak housing market and economic recovery. Economies seeking to create a strong housing finance system are advised to “go back to basics”—ensuring safe loan origination and encourag-ing simple and transparent mortgage contracts.\\nGLOBAL  FiNANCiAL  STABiLiT y REPORT Durable FInancIal StabIlIty: GettInG  there FroM  here'],\n",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxviiIn redesigning regulation and market practices, \\nthe benefits of transferring credit risk outside the banking system and the ability of lenders to diversify funding sources need to be retained.\\nThe chapter suggests that a robust private \\nsecuritization market requires policy action in several areas, including credit rating agency oversight, accounting practices, capital charges, and retention policies. This action needs to be coordinated across regulators within a country and internationally. The chapter illustrates the potential dangers of uncoordinated responses by examining the impact of retention policies and capital requirements imposed on origina-tors and shows that these could, in some cases, fail to encourage screening and monitoring or, in other cases, make securitization prohibitively expensive. Undertaking careful impact stud-\\nies before introducing new regulations should \\nensure that their interaction and potential for damaging unintended consequences is recog-nized in advance.  \\nThe chapter also examines the benefits \\nand costs of issuing covered bonds, in which the loan cash flows are pooled but kept on the balance sheet of the issuing entity. This method has the advantage that the issuer has \\nan incentive to screen and monitor the loans, \\nbut because they remain on the issuer’s balance sheet, capital must still be held against them, reducing the benefits of securitization. None-theless, the advantages of capital-market-type financing—selling the bonds to investors—al-lows more intermediation to occur. On balance, the chapter concludes that this model, too, should be encouraged with appropriate legisla-tion and regulation.\\nPolicies Needed to Underpin Financial \\nSystem Recovery and Reform\\nThe policy response to dislocations in fund-\\ning and credit markets has been unprecedented \\nand, though definitive conclusions are difficult to make on the longer-term benefits, the initial evidence is generally positive. Chapter 3 takes \\nan early look at the very short-term impact and more medium-term effects of conventional and \\nunconventional policy responses, including whether they stabilized financial markets at the time of their announcement. \\nSome unconventional policies have provided support \\nbetter than others. \\nThe chapter looks at the impact of interven-\\ntion announcements made by 13 advanced \\neconomies. Those aimed at supporting liquidity were most effective prior to the Lehman Broth-ers event, but were less so once it was evident \\nthat the financial crisis had become one of \\nsolvency rather than liquidity risk in a number \\nof countries. Correspondingly, announcements \\nof capital injections were most effective in \\nreducing the default risk of banks in the post-Lehman period, as was the announcement of the potential use of asset purchases. Another important result is that interventions aimed at domestic institutions or markets had important spillover effects to other countries, with mag-nitudes sometimes larger than in the home country. This underlines the critical importance of coordinating policy responses.   \\nAlthough it is too soon to gauge with confi-\\ndence the longer-term effects of these policy actions, initial evidence suggests that some facilities have been effective in supporting fund-ing and issuance activity. Examples include the bank liability guarantees introduced in several countries, the U.S. Term Asset-Backed Securi-ties Loan Facility with its impact on secondary market spreads and issuance of consumer asset-\\nbacked securities, and the European Central \\nBank’s decision to purchase covered bonds outright, which helped to lower spreads and reenergize issuance.\\nIt is too early to withdraw official support policies, but a \\nstrategy for disengagement is needed.\\nWhile the time is not ripe for a full-fledged \\ndisengagement from all the unconventional \\npolicies undertaken—indeed in some countries additional public resources may still be need-ed—it is time for policymakers to consider and \\narticulate how and in what sequence policies  xv\\nProspects for the Road Ahead\\nThe immediate outlook for the financial \\nsystem has improved markedly since the April \\n2009 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) \\nand extreme tail risks have abated. Financial markets have rebounded, emerging market risks have eased, banks have raised capital, and wholesale funding markets have reopened. Even so, credit channels are still impaired and the economic recovery is likely to be slow. Chapter \\n1 first chronicles the path toward reestablishing \\nsound credit intermediation and the near-term risks that could interrupt its restoration, includ-ing the rising burden of sovereign financing. The chapter then examines how near-term policies should be managed to provide a secure \\nbackdrop for economic recovery and a with-\\ndrawal of extraordinary public support to the financial system. Some medium-term policy \\noptions are also discussed that aim to reshape \\nthe financial landscape. Extreme systemic risks have abated, but complacency \\nabout banking system repair is still a concern.\\nA key question addressed is whether the \\nfinancial system can provide sufficient credit to \\nsustain an economic recovery. Recently, bank balance sheets have benefited from capital-raising efforts and positive earnings. Nonethe-less, there are still serious concerns that credit deterioration will continue to put pressure on \\nbanks’ balance sheets. Our analysis suggests that \\nU.S. banks are more than halfway through the loss cycle to 2010, whereas in Europe loss recog-nition is less advanced, reflecting differences in the economic cycle. \\nWhile stronger bank earnings are supporting \\ncapital levels, they are not expected to fully off-set writedowns over the next 18 months. More-over, steady-state earnings are likely to be lower in the post-crisis environment. Stronger action to address impaired assets will help bolster bank earning capability and support lending. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nSystemic risks have been substantially reduced following unprecedented policy actions and nascent \\nsigns of improvement in the real economy. There is growing confidence that the global economy has turned the corner, underpinning the improvements in financial markets. Nonetheless, the risk of a reintensification of the adverse feedback loop between the real and financial sectors remains sig-\\nnificant as long as banks remain under strain and households and financial institutions need to \\nreduce leverage. Although indicators of sovereign risk are lower than six months ago, the transfer of financial risks to fiscal authorities, combined with the financing burden of fiscal stimulus, has raised concerns over crowding out the private sector and the sustainability of public sector finances. These vulnerabilities underscore the need to strengthen financial intermediation, restore health to the financial system, and eventually reduce the private risks now borne by sovereign balance sheets. Great care in disengaging from public support will be necessary to avoid either sparking a second-ary crisis through premature withdrawal or endangering monetary and fiscal credibility through a belated exit. Complacency now becomes a risk—banking system problems could go unresolved and much-needed regulatory reforms may be delayed or diluted. Policymakers should promptly provide \\na plan for the future regulatory framework that mitigates the buildup of systemic risks, grounds \\nexpectations, and underpins confidence, thereby contributing to sustained economic growth.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxviThe tightening of bank regulation under way \\nis expected to reduce net revenues and require \\nmore costly self-insurance through higher levels of capital and liquidity.\\nCrisis risks in emerging markets have subsided, but \\nvulnerabilities remain. \\nTail risks in emerging markets have declined \\nas a result of strong policy measures—including \\nincreased IMF resources. Financial stresses have eased substantially in emerging Europe, but vulnerabilities remain high. Western European \\nbanks appear able to absorb deteriorating \\ncredit conditions in emerging Europe, but may lack sufficient capital to support a recovery in \\nthe region. Asia and Latin America have bene -\\nfited most from the stabilization of core markets and a recovery in portfolio inflows. Although \\ninternational flows into emerging market debt \\nhave recovered, they have been skewed toward \\nhigher quality borrowers, leaving many corpo -\\nrates facing substantial rollover risks, particu -\\nlarly in emerging Europe. Financial policies \\nshould continue to foster an orderly adjustment \\nof bank, corporate, and household balance sheets. Extending agreements to maintain or \\neven increase sustainable cross-border bank \\nfunding channels would also help.\\nImpaired credit channels may face difficulty meeting \\neven tepid private sector demand.\\nWith ongoing bank deleveraging pressure and \\ndislocations in securitization markets, our sce-\\nnarios envisage the supply of bank credit falling \\nfor the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 both in \\nthe United States and Europe. When set against \\nprojected demand for credit by the public and private sectors, it appears that ex ante supply \\nmay fall short of even anemic private sector \\ndemand. As a result, pressure on funding rates \\ncould increase and the flow of credit to support \\nrecovery could be curtailed. The results high-\\nlight which areas are likely to suffer the tightest \\ncredit conditions and where prolonged policy interventions are needed to ensure an adequate \\nflow of credit, particularly with the authorities’ \\nobjective of keeping interest rates low.The transfer of private risks to sovereign balance sheets \\nneeds careful management.\\nThe transfer of risk to public balance sheets \\nas a result of financial system rescues and fis-\\ncal stimulus packages has raised concerns that \\nrecord sovereign issuance could push up interest \\nrates and hurt the nascent recovery. In this con-text, credit capacity could struggle to meet even tepid private sector demand, while deteriorat-ing public finances may compromise sovereign creditworthiness. Countries should mitigate this risk by designing and articulating medium-term \\nfiscal consolidation plans that take into account \\ntheir financial sector stabilization policies and \\ncontingent liabilities.\\nFinancial institutions need further restructuring to ensure \\ntheir ability to lend and support economic recovery.\\nCredit capacity constraints suggest little room \\nfor complacency in cleansing bank balance \\nsheets of impaired and illiquid assets and resus-citating securitization. Deeper financial reform and the resolution of weak banks will be needed before authorities in many jurisdictions can fully exit from liquidity and funding provision. This calls for renewed efforts to increase bank capital \\nand cleanse troubled assets from bank balance \\nsheets. Official stress tests are important instru-\\nments through which the condition of banks \\ncan be diagnosed in order to design appropri-\\nate strategies for recapitalization of viable banks \\nand for careful resolution of nonviable banks. \\nHowever, the public release of bank-by-bank \\noutcomes should be considered only if effective \\nremedies to address any capital shortfalls can \\nalso be presented. Nondisclosure should not imply the absence of such remedies, if needed.\\nIncentives are critical to repair and restart securitization.\\nGiven the importance of repairing credit \\nintermediation, Chapter 2 examines the role of private securitization and assesses proposals to restart the market. A combination of new regulation and better private sector practice will be needed to align incentives of those institu-tions taking part in securitization and avoid it contributing to systemic instability once more. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxviiIn redesigning regulation and market practices, \\nthe benefits of transferring credit risk outside the banking system and the ability of lenders to diversify funding sources need to be retained.\\nThe chapter suggests that a robust private \\nsecuritization market requires policy action in several areas, including credit rating agency oversight, accounting practices, capital charges, and retention policies. This action needs to be coordinated across regulators within a country and internationally. The chapter illustrates the potential dangers of uncoordinated responses by examining the impact of retention policies and capital requirements imposed on origina-tors and shows that these could, in some cases, fail to encourage screening and monitoring or, in other cases, make securitization prohibitively expensive. Undertaking careful impact stud-\\nies before introducing new regulations should \\nensure that their interaction and potential for damaging unintended consequences is recog-nized in advance.  \\nThe chapter also examines the benefits \\nand costs of issuing covered bonds, in which the loan cash flows are pooled but kept on the balance sheet of the issuing entity. This method has the advantage that the issuer has \\nan incentive to screen and monitor the loans, \\nbut because they remain on the issuer’s balance sheet, capital must still be held against them, reducing the benefits of securitization. None-theless, the advantages of capital-market-type financing—selling the bonds to investors—al-lows more intermediation to occur. On balance, the chapter concludes that this model, too, should be encouraged with appropriate legisla-tion and regulation.\\nPolicies Needed to Underpin Financial \\nSystem Recovery and Reform\\nThe policy response to dislocations in fund-\\ning and credit markets has been unprecedented \\nand, though definitive conclusions are difficult to make on the longer-term benefits, the initial evidence is generally positive. Chapter 3 takes \\nan early look at the very short-term impact and more medium-term effects of conventional and \\nunconventional policy responses, including whether they stabilized financial markets at the time of their announcement. \\nSome unconventional policies have provided support \\nbetter than others. \\nThe chapter looks at the impact of interven-\\ntion announcements made by 13 advanced \\neconomies. Those aimed at supporting liquidity were most effective prior to the Lehman Broth-ers event, but were less so once it was evident \\nthat the financial crisis had become one of \\nsolvency rather than liquidity risk in a number \\nof countries. Correspondingly, announcements \\nof capital injections were most effective in \\nreducing the default risk of banks in the post-Lehman period, as was the announcement of the potential use of asset purchases. Another important result is that interventions aimed at domestic institutions or markets had important spillover effects to other countries, with mag-nitudes sometimes larger than in the home country. This underlines the critical importance of coordinating policy responses.   \\nAlthough it is too soon to gauge with confi-\\ndence the longer-term effects of these policy actions, initial evidence suggests that some facilities have been effective in supporting fund-ing and issuance activity. Examples include the bank liability guarantees introduced in several countries, the U.S. Term Asset-Backed Securi-ties Loan Facility with its impact on secondary market spreads and issuance of consumer asset-\\nbacked securities, and the European Central \\nBank’s decision to purchase covered bonds outright, which helped to lower spreads and reenergize issuance.\\nIt is too early to withdraw official support policies, but a \\nstrategy for disengagement is needed.\\nWhile the time is not ripe for a full-fledged \\ndisengagement from all the unconventional \\npolicies undertaken—indeed in some countries additional public resources may still be need-ed—it is time for policymakers to consider and \\narticulate how and in what sequence policies EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nxviiimay be unwound. Timing is complicated by the \\nfact that some policies may be effective even if their usage is limited, as they may be bolstering \\nconfidence or acting as a backstop to a class of institutions or investors.\\nChapter 3 outlines some considerations \\nregarding the modalities and timing of unwind-\\ning unconventional policies. In general, if a \\nfacility can be phased out by raising its costs \\nor gradually decreasing its availability, one can attempt to wean the private sector from sup-\\nport in a gradual manner. Expensive policies \\nor those where costs are not commensurate with the benefits should be considered first for \\nwithdrawal, as should policies that significantly \\ndistort financial markets. Importantly, given \\nthe global nature of the crisis and the types of \\nunconventional policies used, attention must \\nbe paid to the cross-border impact of unwind-\\ning, and coordination may be helpful, notably \\nwith regard to the withdrawal of guarantees \\nfor bank debt across countries where poten-\\ntial arbitrage opportunities can arise. Clarity \\nof communication over withdrawal strategy is \\ncritical. In this context, the use of signposts—\\ndescribed in terms of indicators of market \\nconditions rather than firm deadlines—may be more helpful for influencing market expecta-\\ntions. Given that this is uncharted territory for policymakers, some experimentation may be \\nappropriate to test market conditions. If war -\\nranted, reinstatement of some facilities should \\nnot be viewed as a setback.\\nA clear vision of future financial system regulation is \\nneeded to provide clarity and boost confidence.\\nIn addition to a well-defined strategy for \\nunwinding unconventional policies, confidence \\nin the financial system will be bolstered by \\nclarity over future regulatory reforms needed \\nto address systemic risks. The recent easing of \\ntail risks should not prompt authorities to relax \\ntheir efforts to map out the path to a more \\nrobust financial system. A holistic, understand-\\nable approach needs to be formulated so that \\nthe private sector can plan appropriately.The priority should be to reform the regula-\\ntory environment so that the probability of a \\nrecurrence of a systemic crisis is significantly reduced. This includes not only defining the extent to which capital, provisions, and liquid-ity buffers are to rise, but also how market discipline is to be reestablished following extensive public sector support of systemic institutions in many countries. There are already proposals that will go some way toward removing procyclicality in the financial system and increasing buffers against losses and liquid-ity dislocations. But hard work lies ahead in devising capital penalties, insurance premiums, supervisory and resolution regimes, and com-petition policies to ensure that no institution is believed to be “too big to fail.” Early guidance at defining criteria for identifying systemically important institutions and markets—such as that being formulated by the International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements for the G-20—should assist in this quest. Once identi-fied, some form of surcharge or disincentive for marginal contributions to systemic risk will need to be formulated and applied.\\nA macroprudential approach to global policymaking is \\nneeded to restore market discipline and ensure that the \\nbenefits of financial integration are preserved.\\nThe further challenge is to place these reforms \\nin the context of an integrated macroprudential \\npolicy framework in which both domestic and cross-border institutions can operate securely. There is now recognition that a combination of microprudential and macroeconomic policies operated procyclically and led to a buildup of leverage and systemic risk. Policymakers will need to address ways in which their own actions exac-erbate systemic risks, regardless of whether they oversee monetary, fiscal, or financial policy. \\nCooperation and consistency in the policy \\nfield must extend across borders.

Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses.

This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries.

In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries.

Already, emerging market economies that have relied on such  flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory \\nofficial support. \\nDespite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced \\neconomies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further \\ndetermined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial \\nmarkets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries. Shrinking economic \\nactivity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their \\ncapital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. Thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning \\nnegative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. Substantial private sector adjustment and \\npublic support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of \\nstabilization. Even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in  financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in \\nmarkets. The key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. Promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should \\nprovide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.   \\nTo mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for \\nbanks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to \\nemerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented \\nto combat the crisis. All these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult \\ncircumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation.  Such international \\ncommitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the G-20 summit in early April. \\nWithout a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by \\nrestructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to \\nexert downward pressure on economic  activity. Though subject to a number of assumptions, our \\nbest estimate of writedowns on U.S. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak \\nof the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the January 2009 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR) Update  to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for \\neconomic growth. In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen. Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses. While perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead.  \\nThe retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, \\nwith a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. Indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export \\nmarkets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions. Though notoriously difficult to forecast, \\ncurrent estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and \\nthat inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future.

Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector.

In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen.

The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions.

However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy.

As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009.

There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. Even so, \\ncontingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in \\ncase circumstances deteriorate further. \\nWithin Europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in \\nboth advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.  The \\nrecently issued report of the “de Larosière Group” provides a good start for discussing intra-\\nEuropean Union coordination and cooperation. Concerns  over the rollover of maturing debt and the \\ncontinued external financing of current account deficits in emerging Europe require action. Joint action is also needed to address banking system  problems—including coordination on stress tests \\ninvolving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as \\npreparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. In cases where \\nwestern European banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging European countries, joint \\ndiscussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. \\nCoordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. \\nPressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. When countries act unilaterally \\nto support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. In a \\nnumber of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or \\npreferably expand) their domestic lending. This  could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face \\nongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove \\ntheir riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. At the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some \\ncountries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. \\n \\nMacroeconomic Policy Consistency and Reinforcement \\nIn order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is  critical to stabilize \\nthe global financial system. As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009. Available via the Internet: \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . \\n xvii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n \\nSetting the Stage for a More Robust Global Financial System \\nThe immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. At the same time, \\nwork is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. In addition to \\nproviding for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of \\ndirection about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and \\nimproving market confidence in the short term. While many of the propo sals below may appear \\nconceptual, their implications are real. Their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes \\nin structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3  \\nThere is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and \\nfunctioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of \\nleverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler \\nfinancial instruments than the pre-crisis period. The private sector has a cen tral  responsibility to \\ncontribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to \\ngovernance and remuneration policies.  \\nSince neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and \\ncontain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key \\ncomponents to preventing future crises. The empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate \\nsystemic risks through better regulation. \\nWhile attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would \\nslow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that \\ngreater emphasis should be placed  on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. At the same \\ntime, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. While we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever \\npossible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide \\nstability is a public good that will be undervalued by  private institutions and regulations will need to \\nforce systemically important firms to  better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. For this \\nto occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. \\nA clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear \\ndelineation of who is the lead systemic regulator.  \\nTo be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be  better defined and \\nmeasured. Chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify  systemically important \\ninstitutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. In some cases,  the measures could be \\nviewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” Even if not formally used, the \\nproposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. Clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order \\nto avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. More \\ndiscussion and research is needed before regulations  based on this work could be put into place.  \\nAs regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of \\nregulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage \\nand reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-\\n                                                 \\n3For a set of recommendations along these lines, see the IMF paper “Lessons of the Financial \\nCrisis for Future Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets and for Liquidity Management,” \\nFebruary 4, 2009. Available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . \\n xviii  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries. Shrinking economic \\nactivity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their \\ncapital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. Thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning \\nnegative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. Substantial private sector adjustment and \\npublic support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of \\nstabilization. Even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in  financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in \\nmarkets. The key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. Promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should \\nprovide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.   \\nTo mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for \\nbanks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to \\nemerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented \\nto combat the crisis. All these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult \\ncircumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation.  Such international \\ncommitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the G-20 summit in early April. \\nWithout a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by \\nrestructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to \\nexert downward pressure on economic  activity. Though subject to a number of assumptions, our \\nbest estimate of writedowns on U.S. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak \\nof the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the January 2009 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR) Update  to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for \\neconomic growth. In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen. Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses. While perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead.  \\nThe retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, \\nwith a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. Indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export \\nmarkets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions. Though notoriously difficult to forecast, \\ncurrent estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and \\nthat inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. Already, emerging market economies that have relied on such  flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory \\nofficial support. \\nDespite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced \\neconomies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further \\ndetermined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial \\nmarkets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. Even so, \\ncontingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in \\ncase circumstances deteriorate further. \\nWithin Europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in \\nboth advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.  The \\nrecently issued report of the “de Larosière Group” provides a good start for discussing intra-\\nEuropean Union coordination and cooperation. Concerns  over the rollover of maturing debt and the \\ncontinued external financing of current account deficits in emerging Europe require action. Joint action is also needed to address banking system  problems—including coordination on stress tests \\ninvolving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as \\npreparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. In cases where \\nwestern European banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging European countries, joint \\ndiscussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. \\nCoordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. \\nPressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. When countries act unilaterally \\nto support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. In a \\nnumber of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or \\npreferably expand) their domestic lending. This  could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face \\nongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove \\ntheir riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. At the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some \\ncountries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. \\n \\nMacroeconomic Policy Consistency and Reinforcement \\nIn order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is  critical to stabilize \\nthe global financial system. As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009. Available via the Internet: \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . \\n xvii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n \\nSetting the Stage for a More Robust Global Financial System \\nThe immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. At the same time, \\nwork is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. In addition to \\nproviding for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of \\ndirection about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and \\nimproving market confidence in the short term. While many of the propo sals below may appear \\nconceptual, their implications are real. Their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes \\nin structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3  \\nThere is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and \\nfunctioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of \\nleverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler \\nfinancial instruments than the pre-crisis period. The private sector has a cen tral  responsibility to \\ncontribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to \\ngovernance and remuneration policies.  \\nSince neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and \\ncontain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key \\ncomponents to preventing future crises. The empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate \\nsystemic risks through better regulation. \\nWhile attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would \\nslow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that \\ngreater emphasis should be placed  on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. At the same \\ntime, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. While we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever \\npossible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide \\nstability is a public good that will be undervalued by  private institutions and regulations will need to \\nforce systemically important firms to  better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. For this \\nto occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. \\nA clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear \\ndelineation of who is the lead systemic regulator.  \\nTo be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be  better defined and \\nmeasured. Chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify  systemically important \\ninstitutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. In some cases,  the measures could be \\nviewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” Even if not formally used, the \\nproposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. Clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order \\nto avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. More \\ndiscussion and research is needed before regulations  based on this work could be put into place.  \\nAs regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of \\nregulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage \\nand reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-\\n                                                 \\n3For a set of recommendations along these lines, see the IMF paper “Lessons of the Financial \\nCrisis for Future Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets and for Liquidity Management,” \\nFebruary 4, 2009. Available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . \\n xviii  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nborder and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. The main \\nlessons can be summarized as follows. \\nDefine systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential \\nregulation. \\nAs recognized by the recent G-20 Communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation \\nneeds to encompass all systemically important institutions. Traditionally, only a core set of large \\nbanks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis  has shown that other nonbank \\nfinancial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. \\nNot only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well.   \\nIn order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of \\ninstitutions and markets. While certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core \\ninstitutions (e.g., investment banks). Moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which \\nthey are placed.  \\nA two-tiered approach may work best. A wider tier would be required to provide \\ninformation from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. \\nThe other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified \\nprudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. While \\nthese institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for \\nconsumer or investor protection purposes. Chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be \\nused to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. These \\nmethods will be further explored as the IMF works toward a practical definition of a systemically \\nimportant institution as requested by the G-20. \\nPrevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality.  \\nNew regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the \\nsubsequent and difficult deleveraging process. Finding solutions for how to limit leverage going \\nforward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation \\nremains challenging. Regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based \\ndecision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. Regulation \\nshould provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and \\nshort-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not \\nexacerbate the present situation.  \\nCapital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that \\npermit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate \\nand are typically underestimated. This would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to \\ncapital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. Ideally, these \\ncountercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and \\nbe built into regulations. This would not limit the capacity of supervisors to  act with supplementary \\nmeasures if needed. An upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a \\nsupplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. \\nAccounting rules and valuation practices should  be strengthened to reflect a broader range \\nof available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. Accounting standard setters and \\nprudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on \\nenabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion,  evaluating approaches \\n xix  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries. Shrinking economic \\nactivity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their \\ncapital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. Thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning \\nnegative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. Substantial private sector adjustment and \\npublic support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of \\nstabilization. Even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in  financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in \\nmarkets. The key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. Promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should \\nprovide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.   \\nTo mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for \\nbanks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to \\nemerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented \\nto combat the crisis. All these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult \\ncircumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation.  Such international \\ncommitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the G-20 summit in early April. \\nWithout a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by \\nrestructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to \\nexert downward pressure on economic  activity. Though subject to a number of assumptions, our \\nbest estimate of writedowns on U.S. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak \\nof the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the January 2009 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR) Update  to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for \\neconomic growth. In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen. Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses. While perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead.  \\nThe retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, \\nwith a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. Indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export \\nmarkets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions. Though notoriously difficult to forecast, \\ncurrent estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and \\nthat inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. Already, emerging market economies that have relied on such  flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory \\nofficial support. \\nDespite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced \\neconomies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further \\ndetermined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial \\nmarkets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. Even so, \\ncontingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in \\ncase circumstances deteriorate further. \\nWithin Europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in \\nboth advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.  The \\nrecently issued report of the “de Larosière Group” provides a good start for discussing intra-\\nEuropean Union coordination and cooperation. Concerns  over the rollover of maturing debt and the \\ncontinued external financing of current account deficits in emerging Europe require action. Joint action is also needed to address banking system  problems—including coordination on stress tests \\ninvolving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as \\npreparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. In cases where \\nwestern European banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging European countries, joint \\ndiscussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. \\nCoordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. \\nPressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. When countries act unilaterally \\nto support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. In a \\nnumber of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or \\npreferably expand) their domestic lending. This  could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face \\nongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove \\ntheir riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. At the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some \\ncountries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. \\n \\nMacroeconomic Policy Consistency and Reinforcement \\nIn order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is  critical to stabilize \\nthe global financial system. As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009. Available via the Internet: \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . \\n xvii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n \\nSetting the Stage for a More Robust Global Financial System \\nThe immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. At the same time, \\nwork is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. In addition to \\nproviding for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of \\ndirection about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and \\nimproving market confidence in the short term. While many of the propo sals below may appear \\nconceptual, their implications are real. Their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes \\nin structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3  \\nThere is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and \\nfunctioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of \\nleverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler \\nfinancial instruments than the pre-crisis period. The private sector has a cen tral  responsibility to \\ncontribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to \\ngovernance and remuneration policies.  \\nSince neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and \\ncontain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key \\ncomponents to preventing future crises. The empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate \\nsystemic risks through better regulation. \\nWhile attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would \\nslow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that \\ngreater emphasis should be placed  on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. At the same \\ntime, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. While we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever \\npossible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide \\nstability is a public good that will be undervalued by  private institutions and regulations will need to \\nforce systemically important firms to  better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. For this \\nto occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. \\nA clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear \\ndelineation of who is the lead systemic regulator.  \\nTo be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be  better defined and \\nmeasured. Chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify  systemically important \\ninstitutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. In some cases,  the measures could be \\nviewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” Even if not formally used, the \\nproposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. Clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order \\nto avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. More \\ndiscussion and research is needed before regulations  based on this work could be put into place.  \\nAs regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of \\nregulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage \\nand reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-\\n                                                 \\n3For a set of recommendations along these lines, see the IMF paper “Lessons of the Financial \\nCrisis for Future Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets and for Liquidity Management,” \\nFebruary 4, 2009. Available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . \\n xviii  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nborder and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. The main \\nlessons can be summarized as follows. \\nDefine systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential \\nregulation. \\nAs recognized by the recent G-20 Communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation \\nneeds to encompass all systemically important institutions. Traditionally, only a core set of large \\nbanks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis  has shown that other nonbank \\nfinancial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. \\nNot only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well.   \\nIn order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of \\ninstitutions and markets. While certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core \\ninstitutions (e.g., investment banks). Moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which \\nthey are placed.  \\nA two-tiered approach may work best. A wider tier would be required to provide \\ninformation from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. \\nThe other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified \\nprudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. While \\nthese institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for \\nconsumer or investor protection purposes. Chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be \\nused to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. These \\nmethods will be further explored as the IMF works toward a practical definition of a systemically \\nimportant institution as requested by the G-20. \\nPrevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality.  \\nNew regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the \\nsubsequent and difficult deleveraging process. Finding solutions for how to limit leverage going \\nforward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation \\nremains challenging. Regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based \\ndecision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. Regulation \\nshould provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and \\nshort-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not \\nexacerbate the present situation.  \\nCapital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that \\npermit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate \\nand are typically underestimated. This would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to \\ncapital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. Ideally, these \\ncountercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and \\nbe built into regulations. This would not limit the capacity of supervisors to  act with supplementary \\nmeasures if needed. An upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a \\nsupplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. \\nAccounting rules and valuation practices should  be strengthened to reflect a broader range \\nof available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. Accounting standard setters and \\nprudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on \\nenabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion,  evaluating approaches \\n xix  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nto valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly \\nuncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair \\nvalue accounting. \\nIt is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to \\nimprove liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. During upswings, greater attention needs to \\nbe given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove \\nvulnerable during downturns. \\nAddress market discipline and information gaps. \\nIt is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. In \\nmany cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed \\nwith systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires \\ninformation about institutions’ exposures to one another. However, in addition to some technical \\ndifficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments \\nto their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. \\nConsistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. \\nBetter information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, \\nderivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of \\nindicators used in early warning frameworks. Disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management \\npractices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of \\nsystemic risk by policymakers. These elements are re inforced by the analysis in Chapters 2 and 3. As \\nwell, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due \\ndiligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis.  \\nStrengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. \\nEnhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in \\ninstitutional and legal settings. Progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling \\nimpediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early \\nremedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border \\nfirms. An appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of \\nregulators overseeing a firm would be essential to  ensure adequate oversight. Home countries should \\nendeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are \\nopen when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. \\nImprove systemic liquidity management. \\nIn terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the \\ncrisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. \\nAnother way of limiting systemic  linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to \\nprovide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting  trades and making the clearing \\nfacility a counterparty to every trade. Recent attempts to provide some of these services for the credit default swap market are welcome. However, allowing a large number of proposed institutions risks diluting much-needed counterparty risk mitigation by splitting up the volumes and reducing netting \\nopportunities. A competitive environment could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures that may compromise risk management systems. Thus, if mult iple clearing facilities are permitted, they should \\nbe subject to strong oversight using globally accepted standards, ensuring the ability to clear and \\n xx  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries. Shrinking economic \\nactivity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their \\ncapital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. Thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning \\nnegative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. Substantial private sector adjustment and \\npublic support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of \\nstabilization. Even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in  financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in \\nmarkets. The key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. Promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should \\nprovide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.   \\nTo mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for \\nbanks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to \\nemerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented \\nto combat the crisis. All these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult \\ncircumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation.  Such international \\ncommitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the G-20 summit in early April. \\nWithout a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by \\nrestructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to \\nexert downward pressure on economic  activity. Though subject to a number of assumptions, our \\nbest estimate of writedowns on U.S. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak \\nof the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the January 2009 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR) Update  to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for \\neconomic growth. In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen. Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses. While perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead.  \\nThe retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, \\nwith a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. Indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export \\nmarkets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions. Though notoriously difficult to forecast, \\ncurrent estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and \\nthat inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. Already, emerging market economies that have relied on such  flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory \\nofficial support. \\nDespite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced \\neconomies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further \\ndetermined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial \\nmarkets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. Even so, \\ncontingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in \\ncase circumstances deteriorate further. \\nWithin Europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in \\nboth advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.  The \\nrecently issued report of the “de Larosière Group” provides a good start for discussing intra-\\nEuropean Union coordination and cooperation. Concerns  over the rollover of maturing debt and the \\ncontinued external financing of current account deficits in emerging Europe require action. Joint action is also needed to address banking system  problems—including coordination on stress tests \\ninvolving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as \\npreparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. In cases where \\nwestern European banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging European countries, joint \\ndiscussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. \\nCoordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. \\nPressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. When countries act unilaterally \\nto support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. In a \\nnumber of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or \\npreferably expand) their domestic lending. This  could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face \\nongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove \\ntheir riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. At the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some \\ncountries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. \\n \\nMacroeconomic Policy Consistency and Reinforcement \\nIn order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is  critical to stabilize \\nthe global financial system. As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009. Available via the Internet: \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . \\n xvii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n \\nSetting the Stage for a More Robust Global Financial System \\nThe immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. At the same time, \\nwork is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. In addition to \\nproviding for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of \\ndirection about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and \\nimproving market confidence in the short term. While many of the propo sals below may appear \\nconceptual, their implications are real. Their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes \\nin structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3  \\nThere is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and \\nfunctioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of \\nleverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler \\nfinancial instruments than the pre-crisis period. The private sector has a cen tral  responsibility to \\ncontribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to \\ngovernance and remuneration policies.  \\nSince neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and \\ncontain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key \\ncomponents to preventing future crises. The empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate \\nsystemic risks through better regulation. \\nWhile attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would \\nslow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that \\ngreater emphasis should be placed  on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. At the same \\ntime, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. While we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever \\npossible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide \\nstability is a public good that will be undervalued by  private institutions and regulations will need to \\nforce systemically important firms to  better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. For this \\nto occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. \\nA clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear \\ndelineation of who is the lead systemic regulator.  \\nTo be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be  better defined and \\nmeasured. Chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify  systemically important \\ninstitutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. In some cases,  the measures could be \\nviewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” Even if not formally used, the \\nproposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. Clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order \\nto avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. More \\ndiscussion and research is needed before regulations  based on this work could be put into place.  \\nAs regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of \\nregulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage \\nand reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-\\n                                                 \\n3For a set of recommendations along these lines, see the IMF paper “Lessons of the Financial \\nCrisis for Future Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets and for Liquidity Management,” \\nFebruary 4, 2009. Available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . \\n xviii  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nborder and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. The main \\nlessons can be summarized as follows. \\nDefine systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential \\nregulation. \\nAs recognized by the recent G-20 Communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation \\nneeds to encompass all systemically important institutions. Traditionally, only a core set of large \\nbanks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis  has shown that other nonbank \\nfinancial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. \\nNot only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well.   \\nIn order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of \\ninstitutions and markets. While certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core \\ninstitutions (e.g., investment banks). Moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which \\nthey are placed.  \\nA two-tiered approach may work best. A wider tier would be required to provide \\ninformation from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. \\nThe other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified \\nprudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. While \\nthese institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for \\nconsumer or investor protection purposes. Chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be \\nused to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. These \\nmethods will be further explored as the IMF works toward a practical definition of a systemically \\nimportant institution as requested by the G-20. \\nPrevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality.  \\nNew regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the \\nsubsequent and difficult deleveraging process. Finding solutions for how to limit leverage going \\nforward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation \\nremains challenging. Regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based \\ndecision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. Regulation \\nshould provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and \\nshort-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not \\nexacerbate the present situation.  \\nCapital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that \\npermit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate \\nand are typically underestimated. This would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to \\ncapital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. Ideally, these \\ncountercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and \\nbe built into regulations. This would not limit the capacity of supervisors to  act with supplementary \\nmeasures if needed. An upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a \\nsupplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. \\nAccounting rules and valuation practices should  be strengthened to reflect a broader range \\nof available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. Accounting standard setters and \\nprudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on \\nenabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion,  evaluating approaches \\n xix  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nto valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly \\nuncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair \\nvalue accounting. \\nIt is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to \\nimprove liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. During upswings, greater attention needs to \\nbe given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove \\nvulnerable during downturns. \\nAddress market discipline and information gaps. \\nIt is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. In \\nmany cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed \\nwith systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires \\ninformation about institutions’ exposures to one another. However, in addition to some technical \\ndifficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments \\nto their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. \\nConsistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. \\nBetter information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, \\nderivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of \\nindicators used in early warning frameworks. Disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management \\npractices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of \\nsystemic risk by policymakers. These elements are re inforced by the analysis in Chapters 2 and 3. As \\nwell, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due \\ndiligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis.  \\nStrengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. \\nEnhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in \\ninstitutional and legal settings. Progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling \\nimpediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early \\nremedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border \\nfirms. An appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of \\nregulators overseeing a firm would be essential to  ensure adequate oversight. Home countries should \\nendeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are \\nopen when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. \\nImprove systemic liquidity management. \\nIn terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the \\ncrisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. \\nAnother way of limiting systemic  linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to \\nprovide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting  trades and making the clearing \\nfacility a counterparty to every trade. Recent attempts to provide some of these services for the credit default swap market are welcome. However, allowing a large number of proposed institutions risks diluting much-needed counterparty risk mitigation by splitting up the volumes and reducing netting \\nopportunities. A competitive environment could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures that may compromise risk management systems. Thus, if mult iple clearing facilities are permitted, they should \\nbe subject to strong oversight using globally accepted standards, ensuring the ability to clear and \\n xx  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nsettle across borders and in multiple currencies. Box 2.4 provides the principles for their \\nconstruction. \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nMany of these recommendations have already been discussed in  international fora and are \\nforming the basis for new or altered regulation or supervisory guidance. The Financial Stability \\nBoard, through its main working group, has estab lished a set of subgroups to provide policy guidance \\nin a number of areas, including some of those emphasized here. The Basel Committee is considering \\nchanges to the Basel II framework and to its liquidity risk management framework. The International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial A ccounting Standards Board have both issued \\nguidance on how to value illiquid assets and have made  other alterations to their accounting guidance \\nand standards given the crisis and its causes. Othe r international organizati ons are reviewing their \\nguidelines and best practices. For its part, the IMF will be revamping its Fina ncial Sector Assessment \\nPrograms as well as improving its multilateral an d bilateral surveillance. The joint Early Warning \\nExercise, conducted by the IMF in cooperation with  the Financial Stability Board, will enhance the \\nglobal coordination of risk assessments with the ai m of making stronger policy recommendations to \\nprevent a buildup of systemic risks. \\n \\n xxi  xi   \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n \\n    \\nThe global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, \\ncorporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced  and emerging market countries. Shrinking economic \\nactivity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their \\ncapital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. Thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning \\nnegative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. Substantial private sector adjustment and \\npublic support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of \\nstabilization. Even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in  financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in \\nmarkets. The key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. Promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should \\nprovide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.   \\nTo mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for \\nbanks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to \\nemerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented \\nto combat the crisis. All these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult \\ncircumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation.  Such international \\ncommitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the G-20 summit in early April. \\nWithout a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by \\nrestructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to \\nexert downward pressure on economic  activity. Though subject to a number of assumptions, our \\nbest estimate of writedowns on U.S. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak \\nof the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the January 2009 Global Financial Stability \\nReport (GFSR) Update  to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for \\neconomic growth. In this GFSR, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other \\nmature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more \\nuncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-\\nthirds of which would be incurred by banks.   \\nThere has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but \\nfunding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is \\ndiminished. While in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term \\ndebt, their funding gap remains large. As a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-\\nsupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much \\nmore elevated yields.   \\nxii A wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as \\nasset prices have fallen. Pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value \\nwhile the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have \\nsimultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. Life insurance companies have suffered \\nlosses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some  cases significantly depl eting their regulatory \\ncapital surpluses. While perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead.  \\nThe retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, \\nwith a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. Indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export \\nmarkets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. The \\nrefinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk \\ncoming from corporates, including financial instit utions. Though notoriously difficult to forecast, \\ncurrent estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and \\nthat inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. Already, emerging market economies that have relied on such  flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory \\nofficial support. \\nDespite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced \\neconomies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further \\ndetermined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial \\nmarkets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. However, \\nthe transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. There are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, \\nincluding open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging \\npopulations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced \\neconomies. Home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and \\nconsumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. \\nThese risks, discussed in Chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the \\npublic sector has faced in half a century. We out line below what we believe are the key elements to \\nbreak the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.   \\n \\nImmediate Policy Recommendations \\nEven if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging \\nprocess will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. The \\naccompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to  cause credit growth in the \\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years.  \\nThis difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and \\nmore decisive action on the policy front where needed. The political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer \\nfunds in some headline cases. There is a real risk  that governments will be  reluctant to allocate \\nenough resources to solve the problem. Moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly \\nsolutions to financial stress. Hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, \\nconsistency, and the reliability of policy responses. Past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that \\nrestoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that  recessions tend to be \\ndeeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see Chapter 3 of the April 2009 \\nWorld Economic Outlook). This same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nimplemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery \\nprocess is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, \\nare even greater.  \\nGiven the global reach of this crisis, the effect  of national policies ca n be strengthened if \\nimplemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. Coordination and collaboration \\nshould build upon the positive momentum created by the recent G-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national \\nactions. Specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and \\navoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. \\nIn the short run, the three priorities identified  in previous GFSRs and explicitly recognized \\nin the February 2009 G-7 Communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has \\naccess to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable \\ninstitutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. In general, the first task is  for central banks, while \\nthe latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. Progress has been made in the \\nfirst area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. Recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in \\norder to determine recapitalization needs. These are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. Lessons from past crises suggest the need \\nfor more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. \\nProceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank  recapitalization. \\nThe long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, \\ntaking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further \\nwritedowns. In order to comprehend the order of  magnitude of total capital needs of Western  \\nbanking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further \\nwritedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. The calculations rely on \\nseveral assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be \\nviewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. The first calculation assumes that leverage, \\nmeasured as tangible common equity (TCE) over ta ngible assets (TA), retu rns to levels prevailing \\nbefore the crisis (4 percent TCE/TA). Even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for U.S. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for U.K. \\nbanks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature Europe. The second illustrative \\ncalculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent TCE/TA). This more \\ndemanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for U.S. banks, \\n$725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for U.K.  banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of \\nmature Europe. These rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting \\nlosses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital \\nratios markets are now demanding,  based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the \\nquality of capital. Without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the TCE/TA ratio, \\nit is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is \\nconverted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the \\ndegree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some  of the bad assets on \\ntheir balance sheets. In the United States, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in \\nrecent years is quite large and could help to raise the TCE/TA ratios if converted. In several \\ncountries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on \\nselected sets of assets by some banks. \\nThus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: \\n xiii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n• A more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and \\nappropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. \\n• Full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. \\n• Clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the \\ntangible common equity or Tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new \\nrequired capital ratios. \\nConditions for public infusion of capital should be strict.  In addition to taking  stock of writedowns \\nand available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of \\nmanagement. Viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the \\ngovernment that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to \\nregain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. While these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully  monitored and dividend \\npayments restricted. Compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management \\nshould be examined carefully. Nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as \\npossible. Such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not \\nendanger system-wide financial stability. \\nRestructuring may require temporary government ownership.  The current inability to attract private \\nmoney suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder \\nsteps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. Temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector \\nas rapidly as possible. Most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the \\nbank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against \\npotential writedowns. Most capita l injections from governments th us far have come  as preferred \\nshares and these have carried with them a high cost  that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other \\nforms of private capital. Consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. Uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. In a systemic banking crisis, \\npreferential treatment of  new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be \\ndestabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. Authorities \\nneed to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a \\n“credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other \\ninstitutions or markets.  \\nCross-border cooperation and consistency is important. Cross-border coordination of the principles \\nunderlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. While difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons \\nbetween their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. \\nAddress “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus \\nguarantees. \\nGiven the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which \\nthey have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. Th e most important priority is to \\nchoose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is  adequately funded, and implement it in a clear \\n xiv  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nmanner. However, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important \\nthat they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. Among the methods being used so far, the United Kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the \\nimpact of further losses. An alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management \\ncompany (AMC) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that Switzerland has adopted with UBS and \\nthat Ireland is also pursuing. This latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent \\nand, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the AMC, leaves the “good bank” with a \\nclean balance sheet. The United St ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are \\neither troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of Citibank and Bank of America, as well as \\nproposing to establish private/public partnerships  to purchase impaired assets from banks. The \\ncurrent proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. In general, different \\napproaches can work depending on country circumstances.  \\nMoreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments \\nneed to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments \\nthat they intend to support. When assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on \\n“fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present \\nvalue of future income streams. Preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, \\nsuch a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid \\noverly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . The Financial Stability \\nBoard, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. \\nProvide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. \\nBank funding markets remain highly stressed  and will only recover once counterparty risks \\nlessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds \\nare to be deployed. Many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have \\nguaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such \\ngovernment backstopping. Even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce \\nfrictions. As a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to \\nbanks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. \\nHowever, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented \\ngradually. Such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use \\nso that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.   \\n \\n* * * \\n \\nIn addition to the three priorities concerning  advanced countries’ banking sectors, other \\nimmediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and \\nthe risk of financial protectionism.  \\nAssure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the  \\ndeleveraging and risk aversion of  advanced economy investors. \\nThe problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now \\nhaving severe effects on emerging market countries. We project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et GDP over the next few years. Under reasonable \\n xv  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nscenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim \\nchances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. \\nAs in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate \\nliquidity in their banking systems. However, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a \\nmajor source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. Thus, \\ncentral banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. Those \\ncentral banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as \\nswap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of IMF facilities, should also be a line of \\ndefense. The greater resources available to the IMF following the G-20 summit can help countries \\nbuffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, \\nlimit the effect on the poor. Moreover, IMF programs  can play a useful role in catalyzing support \\nfrom others in some cases. \\nThe vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the \\ncorporate sector. Direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. Some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. Some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. Even so, \\ncontingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in \\ncase circumstances deteriorate further. \\nWithin Europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in \\nboth advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions.  The \\nrecently issued report of the “de Larosière Group” provides a good start for discussing intra-\\nEuropean Union coordination and cooperation. Concerns  over the rollover of maturing debt and the \\ncontinued external financing of current account deficits in emerging Europe require action. Joint action is also needed to address banking system  problems—including coordination on stress tests \\ninvolving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as \\npreparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. In cases where \\nwestern European banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging European countries, joint \\ndiscussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. \\nCoordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. \\nPressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. When countries act unilaterally \\nto support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. In a \\nnumber of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or \\npreferably expand) their domestic lending. This  could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face \\nongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove \\ntheir riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. At the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some \\ncountries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. \\n \\nMacroeconomic Policy Consistency and Reinforcement \\nIn order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is  critical to stabilize \\nthe global financial system. As also noted in the April 2009 World Economic Outlook, policies aimed at \\nthe financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and \\nmonetary policies.   \\n xvi  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nPromote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. \\nRestoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. Fiscal stimulus to support \\neconomic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of \\nborrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster \\nbanks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. Also, seed funds for private-public \\npartnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans.  \\nFor those countries where there is fiscal room to  maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at \\npositively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. However, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. \\nAlready, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is \\nevident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the \\nfinancial system is large compared to the economic  size of the country. Although there has been \\nsome improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. Authorities should reduce their \\nrefinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows.  \\nIt is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the \\ndegree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus \\npackage, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.\\n1 Where stimulus \\npackages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-\\nterm fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 Without such policies, governments \\nmay risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency.  \\nUse unconventional central bank policies to  reopen credit and funding markets, if  \\nneeded.  \\nA number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense \\nagainst the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. In some cases, unconventional \\ncentral bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to \\nbe considered. The effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that \\nmoves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more \\ncommon. As central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate \\nexit strategies when conditions improve. Govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the \\nintegrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence.  \\nFor some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is \\ncomplicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. Some co untries may have no scope \\nto lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. As with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. Some countries may be able to ease pressures on  the exchange rates by providing foreign currency \\nliquidity. \\n                                                 \\n1See  the section entitled “Costs of Official Support, Potential Spillovers, and Policy Risks” in \\nChapter 1; and Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. \\n2See the IMF paper “The State of Public Finances: Outlook and Medium-Term Policies After the \\n2008 Crisis,” March 6, 2009. Available via the Internet: \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . \\n xvii  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\n \\nSetting the Stage for a More Robust Global Financial System \\nThe immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. At the same time, \\nwork is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. In addition to \\nproviding for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of \\ndirection about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and \\nimproving market confidence in the short term. While many of the propo sals below may appear \\nconceptual, their implications are real. Their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes \\nin structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3  \\nThere is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and \\nfunctioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of \\nleverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler \\nfinancial instruments than the pre-crisis period. The private sector has a cen tral  responsibility to \\ncontribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to \\ngovernance and remuneration policies.  \\nSince neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and \\ncontain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key \\ncomponents to preventing future crises. The empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate \\nsystemic risks through better regulation. \\nWhile attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would \\nslow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that \\ngreater emphasis should be placed  on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. At the same \\ntime, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. While we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever \\npossible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide \\nstability is a public good that will be undervalued by  private institutions and regulations will need to \\nforce systemically important firms to  better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. For this \\nto occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. \\nA clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear \\ndelineation of who is the lead systemic regulator.  \\nTo be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be  better defined and \\nmeasured. Chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify  systemically important \\ninstitutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. In some cases,  the measures could be \\nviewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” Even if not formally used, the \\nproposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. Clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order \\nto avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. More \\ndiscussion and research is needed before regulations  based on this work could be put into place.  \\nAs regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of \\nregulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage \\nand reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-\\n                                                 \\n3For a set of recommendations along these lines, see the IMF paper “Lessons of the Financial \\nCrisis for Future Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets and for Liquidity Management,” \\nFebruary 4, 2009. Available via the Internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . \\n xviii  \\n \\n \\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nborder and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. The main \\nlessons can be summarized as follows. \\nDefine systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential \\nregulation. \\nAs recognized by the recent G-20 Communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation \\nneeds to encompass all systemically important institutions. Traditionally, only a core set of large \\nbanks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis  has shown that other nonbank \\nfinancial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. \\nNot only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well.   \\nIn order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of \\ninstitutions and markets. While certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core \\ninstitutions (e.g., investment banks). Moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which \\nthey are placed.  \\nA two-tiered approach may work best. A wider tier would be required to provide \\ninformation from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. \\nThe other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified \\nprudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. While \\nthese institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for \\nconsumer or investor protection purposes. Chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be \\nused to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. These \\nmethods will be further explored as the IMF works toward a practical definition of a systemically \\nimportant institution as requested by the G-20. \\nPrevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality.  \\nNew regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the \\nsubsequent and difficult deleveraging process. Finding solutions for how to limit leverage going \\nforward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation \\nremains challenging. Regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based \\ndecision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. Regulation \\nshould provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and \\nshort-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not \\nexacerbate the present situation.  \\nCapital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that \\npermit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate \\nand are typically underestimated. This would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to \\ncapital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. Ideally, these \\ncountercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and \\nbe built into regulations. This would not limit the capacity of supervisors to  act with supplementary \\nmeasures if needed. An upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a \\nsupplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. \\nAccounting rules and valuation practices should  be strengthened to reflect a broader range \\nof available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. Accounting standard setters and \\nprudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on \\nenabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion,  evaluating approaches \\n xix  \\n \\n \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \\nto valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly \\nuncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair \\nvalue accounting. \\nIt is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to \\nimprove liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. During upswings, greater attention needs to \\nbe given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove \\nvulnerable during downturns. \\nAddress market discipline and information gaps. \\nIt is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. In \\nmany cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed \\nwith systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires \\ninformation about institutions’ exposures to one another. However, in addition to some technical \\ndifficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments \\nto their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. \\nConsistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. \\nBetter information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, \\nderivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of \\nindicators used in early warning frameworks. Disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management \\npractices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of \\nsystemic risk by policymakers. These elements are re inforced by the analysis in Chapters 2 and 3. As \\nwell, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due \\ndiligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis.  \\nStrengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. \\nEnhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in \\ninstitutional and legal settings. Progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling \\nimpediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early \\nremedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border \\nfirms. An appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of \\nregulators overseeing a firm would be essential to  ensure adequate oversight. Home countries should \\nendeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are \\nopen when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. \\nImprove systemic liquidity management. \\nIn terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the \\ncrisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. \\nAnother way of limiting systemic  linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to \\nprovide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting  trades and making the clearing \\nfacility a counterparty to every trade.

financial policies should be used to support economies stricken by the pandemic. international cooperation is essential to tackle this extraordinary global crisis. international monetary fund | april 2020 xito that end, authorities across the globe have already implemented wide-ranging policies. the april 2020 fiscal monitor describes the fiscal support packages that have been announced by governments across the globe. large, timely, temporary, and targeted fiscal measures are necessary to ensure that a temporary shutdown of activity does not lead to more permanent damage to the productive capacity of the economy and to society as a whole. central banks globally have taken bold and decisive actions by easing monetary policy, purchasing a range of assets, and providing liquidity to the financial system in an effort to lean against the tightening in financial conditions and maintain the flow of credit to the economy. as policy rates are now near or below zero in many major advanced economies, unconventional measures and forward guidance about the expected policy path are becoming the main tools for these central banks going forward. central banks may also consider further measures to support the economy during these challenging times. policymakers need to maintain a balance between safeguarding financial stability and supporting economic activity. banks. in the first instance, banks’ existing capital and liquidity buffers should be used to absorb losses and funding pressures. in cases where the impact is sizable or longer lasting and bank capital adequacy is affected, supervisors should take targeted actions, including asking banks to submit credible capital restoration plans. authorities may also need to step in with fiscal support—either direct subsidies or tax relief—to help borrowers to repay their loans and finance their operations, or provide credit guarantees to banks. supervisors should also encourage banks to negotiate, in a prudent manner, temporary adjustments to loan terms for companies and households struggling to service their debts. asset managers. to prudently manage liquidity risks associated with large outflows, regulators should encourage fund managers to make full use of the available liquidity tools where it would be in the interests of unit holders to do so. financial markets. market resilience should be promoted through well-calibrated, clearly defined, and appropriately communicated measures, such as circuit breakers. many emerging market economies are already facing volatile market conditions and should manage these pressures through exchange rate flexibility, where feasible. for countries with adequate reserves, exchange rate intervention can lean against market illiquidity and thus play a role in muting excessive volatility. however, interventions should not prevent necessary adjustments in the exchange rate. in the face of an imminent crisis, capital flow management measures could be part of a broad policy package, but they cannot substitute for warranted macroeconomic adjustment. sovereign debt managers should prepare for longer-term funding disruptions by putting contingency plans in place to deal with limited access to external financing. multilateral cooperation is essential to help reduce the intensity of the covid-19 shock and its damage to the global economy and financial system. countries confronting the twin crises of health and external funding shocks—for example, those reliant on external financing or commodity exporters dealing with the plunge in commodity prices—may additionally need bilateral or multilateral assistance to ensure that health spending is not compromised in their difficult adjustment process. official bilateral creditors have been called upon by the imf managing director and the world bank president to suspend debt payments from countries below the international development association’s operational threshold that request forbearance while they battle the pandemic. the imf , with $1 trillion in available resources, is actively supporting member countries.',\n",

picking up and the recovery becoming more synchronized around the world. while still supportive of economic growth, global financial conditions have tightened somewhat since the october 2017 global financial stability report (gfsr). such a tightening reflects primarily the bout of equity volatility in early february and a decline in risky asset prices at the end of march follow-ing concerns about a wider escalation of protectionist measures.short-term risks to financial stability have increased somewhat relative to the previous gfsr, and medium-term risks continue to be elevated. financial vulner-abilities, which have accumulated during years of extremely low rates and volatility, could make the road ahead bumpy and could put growth at risk. indeed, growth-at-risk analysis (described in chapter 3 of the october 2017 gfsr) shows that risks to medium-term economic growth, stemming from easy financial conditions, remain well above historical norms. in advanced economies, stronger growth momen-tum and the firming of inflation have eased to some extent a key challenge facing central banks: maintain-ing the monetary accommodation required to support the economic recovery while addressing medium-term financial vulnerabilities. but the firming of inflation also brings risks. for example, inflation may pick up faster than currently anticipated, possibly propelled by significant fiscal expansion enacted in the united states. central banks may respond to higher inflation more aggressively than currently expected, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. this tightening could spill over to risky asset prices, bank dollar funding markets, and both emerging market economies and low-income countries, as discussed below. to minimize these risks, central banks should continue to normalize monetary policy gradually and communicate their decisions clearly to support the economic recovery.valuations of risky assets are still stretched, with some late-stage credit cycle dynamics emerging, reminiscent of the precrisis period. this makes markets exposed to a sharp tightening in financial conditions, which could lead to a sudden unwinding of risk premi-ums and a repricing of risky assets. moreover, liquidity mismatches and the use of financial leverage to boost returns could amplify the impact of asset price moves on the financial system. although no major disrup-tions were reported during the episode of volatility in early february, market participants should not take too much comfort. investors and policymakers must remain attuned to the risks associated with higher interest rates and greater volatility. policymakers should address financial vulnerabilities by using more actively the micro- and macroprudential tools at their disposal or by enhancing their toolkits as needed—for example, to address risks in the nonbank financial sector.the banking sector has become more resilient since the global financial crisis. however, it is important to ensure that the postcrisis regulatory reform agenda is completed. in advanced economies some weaker banks still need to strengthen their balance sheets, and some institutions operating internationally run dollar liquidity mismatches. a sudden spell of turbulence in financial markets could expose these mismatches and crystallize dollar funding strains. a number of emerging market economies have taken advantage of an extended period of benign exter-nal financial conditions to improve their fundamentals. however, they could be vulnerable to a sudden tight-ening of global financial conditions or spillovers from monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, resulting in an increase in risk aversion and capital flow reversals. the severity of such potential shocks will differ across countries, depending on economic fundamentals and the policy responses to those shocks. although regulators in china have taken steps to address risks stemming from the interconnectedness of the banking and shadow banking sectors, vulnerabili-ties remain high. further regulatory actions are crucial to continue reducing risks in the financial sector.

international monetary fund | april 2018global financial stability report: a bumpy road aheadthe technology behind crypto assets has the poten-tial to make the financial market infrastructure more efficient. however, crypto assets have been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures, and have been associated with illicit activities. at present, crypto assets do not appear to pose financial stability risks, but they could do so should their use become more widespread without appropriate safeguards.chapter 2 takes a comprehensive look at the evolu-tion of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation, given concerns that the continued search for higher yield may have led banks and investors to extend too much credit to risky borrowers. the chapter docu-ments a pattern in which the firms obtaining more credit are relatively riskier during periods of strong credit expansion, especially when lending standards are loose or financial conditions are easy. an increase in the riskiness of credit allocation signals heightened downside risks to gdp growth and a higher prob-ability of banking stress, in addition to the previously documented signals provided by credit growth. coun-try authorities can use the measures introduced in this chapter to monitor the buildup of vulnerabilities via risk taking in credit allocation. the chapter discusses policies that can mitigate the increase in credit riski-ness during credit expansions. chapter 3 documents a striking increase in house price synchronization among 40 countries and 44 major cities in advanced and emerging market econo-mies over the past several decades. the exposure of countries and cities to global financial conditions may help explain that increase. rising housing valuations since the global financial crisis raise the specter of a simultaneous decline in house prices should financial conditions reverse. the chapter suggests that height-ened synchronicity of house prices can signal a higher probability of adverse scenarios for the real economy, especially when credit is high or rapidly expanding.

deleveraging in china: challenges aheadsteady growth in china and financial policy tighten-ing in recent quarters have eased concerns about a near-term slowdown and negative spillovers to the global economy. however, the size, complexity, and pace of growth in china’s financial system point to elevated financial stability risks. banking sector assets, at 310 percent of gdp , have risen from 240 percent of gdp at the end of 2012. furthermore, the grow-ing use of short-term wholesale funding and “shadow credit” to firms has increased vulnerabilities at banks. authorities face a delicate balance between tightening financial sector policies and slowing economic growth. reducing the growth of shadow credit even modestly would weigh on the profitability and broader provision of credit by small and medium-sized banks. global banks’ health is improvingthe health of global systemically important banks (gsibs) continues to improve. balance sheets are stron-ger because of improved capital and liquidity buffers, amid tighter regulation and heightened market scrutiny. considerable progress has been made in addressing legacy issues and restructuring challenges. at the same time, while many banks have strengthened their profit-ability by reorienting business models, several continue to grapple with legacy issues and business model chal-lenges. banks representing about $17 trillion

extraordinary policy support, regulatory enhancements, and the cyclical upturn in growth. the health of banks in many advanced economies contin-ues to improve, as progress has been made in resolv-ing some weaker banks, while a majority of systemic institutions are adjusting business models and restoring profitability. the upswing in global economic activity, discussed in the october 2017 world economic outlook (weo), has boosted market confidence while reducing near-term threats to financial stability. but beyond these recent improvements, the environ-ment of continuing monetary accommodation—neces-sary to support activity and boost inflation—is also leading to rising asset valuations and higher leverage. financial stability risks are shifting from the bank-ing system toward nonbank and market sectors of the financial system. these developments and risks call for delicately balancing the eventual normalization of monetary policies, while avoiding a further buildup of financial risks outside the banking sector and address-ing remaining legacy problems. the two sides of monetary policy normalizationthe baseline path for the global economy, envisaged by central banks and financial markets, foresees contin-ued support from accommodative monetary policies, as inflation rates are expected to recover only slowly. thus, the gradual process of normalizing monetary policies is likely to take several years. too fast a pace of nor-malization would remove needed support for sustained recovery and desired increases in core inflation across major economies. unconventional monetary policies and quantitative easing have forced substantial portfolio adjustments in the private sector and across borders, making the adjustment of financial markets much less predictable than in previous cycles. abrupt or ill-timed shifts could cause unwanted turbulence in financial markets and reverberate across borders and markets. yet the prolonged monetary support envisaged for the major economies may lead to the buildup of further financial excesses. as the search for yield intensifies, vulnerabilities are shifting to the nonbank sector, and market risks are rising. there is too much money chasing too few yield-ing assets: less than 5 percent ($1.8 trillion) of the cur-rent stock of global investment-grade fixed-income assets yields over 4 percent, compared with 80 percent ($15.8 trillion) before the crisis. asset valuations are becoming stretched in some markets as investors are pushed out of their natural risk habitats, and accept higher credit and liquidity risk to boost returns. at the same time, indebtedness among the major global economies is increasing. leverage in the non-financial sector is now higher than before the global financial crisis in the group of t wenty economies as a whole. while this has helped facilitate the economic recovery, it has left the nonfinancial sector more vul-nerable to changes in interest rates. the rise in leverage has led to a rise in private sector debt service ratios in several of the major economies, despite the low level of interest rates. this is stretching the debt servicing capacity of weaker borrowers in some countries and sectors. debt servicing pressures and debt levels in the private nonfinancial sector are already high in several major economies (australia, canada, china, korea), increasing their sensitivity to tighter financial condi-tions and weaker economic activity. the key challenge confronting policymakers is to ensure that the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is contained while monetary policy remains supportive of the global recovery. otherwise, rising debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could undermine market confidence in the future, with repercussions that could put global growth at risk. this report exam-ines such a downside scenario, in which a repricing of risks leads to sharp increases in credit costs, falling asset prices, and a pullback from emerging markets. the economic impact of this tightening of global financial conditions would be significant (about one-third as severe as the global financial crisis) and more broad-based (global output would fall 1.7 percent relative to the weo baseline with varying cross-coun-try effects). monetary normalization would go into executive su mm ary international monetary fund | october 2017 xireverse in the united states and would stall elsewhere. emerging market economies would be disproportion-ately affected, resulting in an estimated $100 billion reduction in portfolio flows over four quarters. bank capital would take the biggest hit where leverage is highest and where banks are most exposed to the housing and corporate sectors. deleveraging in china: challenges aheadsteady growth in china and financial policy tighten-ing in recent quarters have eased concerns about a near-term slowdown and negative spillovers to the global economy. however, the size, complexity, and pace of growth in china’s financial system point to elevated financial stability risks. banking sector assets, at 310 percent of gdp , have risen from 240 percent of gdp at the end of 2012. furthermore, the grow-ing use of short-term wholesale funding and “shadow credit” to firms has increased vulnerabilities at banks. authorities face a delicate balance between tightening financial sector policies and slowing economic growth. reducing the growth of shadow credit even modestly would weigh on the profitability and broader provision of credit by small and medium-sized banks. global banks’ health is improvingthe health of global systemically important banks (gsibs) continues to improve. balance sheets are stron-ger because of improved capital and liquidity buffers, amid tighter regulation and heightened market scrutiny. considerable progress has been made in addressing legacy issues and restructuring challenges. at the same time, while many banks have strengthened their profit-ability by reorienting business models, several continue to grapple with legacy issues and business model chal-lenges. banks representing about $17 trillion in assets, or about one-third of the gsib total, may continue to generate unsustainable returns, even in 2019. as problems in even a single gsib could generate systemic stress, supervisory actions should remain focused on business model risks and sustainable profitability. life insurers have also been adapting their business strate-gies in the low-yield environment following the global financial crisis. they

supportive external conditions to enhance their resilience, including by continu-ing to strengthen external positions where needed, and reduce corporate leverage where it is high. this would put these economies in a better position to withstand a reduction in capital inflows as a result of monetary normalization in advanced economies or waning global risk appetite. similarly, frontier market and low-income-country borrowers should develop the institutional capacity to deal with risks from the issuance of marketable securities, including formulating comprehensive medium-term debt man-agement strategies. this will enable them to take advantage of broader financial market development and access, while containing the associated risks.• in china, the authorities have taken welcome steps to address risks in the financial system, but there is still work to do. vulnerabilities will be difficult to address without slower credit growth. recent policies to improve the risk management and transparency of the banking system and reduce the buildup of maturity and liquidity transformation risks in banks’ shadow credit activities are essential and must continue. how-ever, policies should also target balance sheet vulnera-bilities at weak banks. the government’s commitment to reducing corporate leverage is welcome and should remain a priority as part of a broader effort to insulate the economy against slower credit growth. • although significant progress has been made in developing the postcrisis policy response, progress remains uneven across the various sectors, with several design and implementation issues remain-ing outstanding. ensuring that the reform mea-sures are completed and implemented is essential to minimize the likelihood of another disruptive crisis. completing the reform agenda will also allow policymakers to conduct a comprehensive evalua-tion of the impact of the reforms and fine-tune the agreed measures. this will allow them to address any material unintended effects their cumulative implementation might have on the provision of key financial services. this is critical to provide contin-ued assurance that reforms have delivered on their objectives and to stave off emerging pressures to roll back these measures, which would only make the financial system more vulnerable.• finally, implementation of structural reforms and supportive fiscal policies (as examined in scenario box 1 of the october 2017 world economic outlook) would lift global growth and generate positive eco-nomic spillovers, reinforcing financial policy efforts.household debt and economic growthchapter 2 examines the short- and medium-term implications for economic growth and financial stability of the past decades’ rise in household debt. the chapter documents large differences in household debt-to-gdp ratios across countries but a common increasing trajec-tory that was moderated but not reversed by the global financial crisis. in advanced economies, with notable exceptions, household debt to gdp increased gradu-ally, from 35 percent in 1980 to about 65 percent in 2016, and has kept growing since the global financial crisis, albeit more slowly. in emerging market econo-mies, the same ratio is still much lower, but increased relatively faster over a shorter period, from 5 percent in 1995 to about 20 percent in 2016. moreover, the rise has been largely unabated in recent years. the chapter finds a trade-off between a short-term boost to growth from higher household debt and a medium-term risk to macroeconomic and financial stability that may result in lower growth, consumption, and employment and a greater risk of banking crises. this trade-off is stronger when household debt is higher and can be attenuated by a combination of good policies, institutions, and regulations. these include appropriate macroprudential and financial sector policies, better financial supervision, less dependence on external financing, flexible exchange rates, and lower income inequality.financial conditions can predict growththe global financial crisis showed policymakers that financial conditions offer valuable information about risks to future growth and provide a basis for targeted preemptive action. chapter 3 develops a new macroeconomic measure of financial stability by link-ing financial conditions to the probability distribution of future gdp growth and applies it to a set of 21 major advanced and emerging market economies. the chapter shows that changes in financial conditions shift the whole distribution of future gdp growth. wider risk spreads, rising asset price volatility, and waning global risk appetite are significant predictors of increased downside risks to growth in the near term, and higher leverage and

       " \"[' international monetary fund | october 2019 ixfinancial markets have been buffeted by the ebb and flow of trade tensions and growing concerns about the global economic outlook. weakening economic activity and increased downside risks have prompted a shift toward a more dovish stance of monetary policy across the globe, a development that has been accompanied by sharp declines in market yields. as a result, the amount of bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15 trillion. investors now expect interest rates to remain very low for longer than anticipated at the beginning of the year. chapter 1 discusses how investors’ search for yield has left asset prices in some markets overstretched and fostered a further easing in financial conditions since the april 2019 global financial stability report.accommodative monetary policy is supporting the economy in the near term, but easy financial condi-tions are encouraging financial risk-taking and are fueling a further buildup of vulnerabilities in some sectors and countries. chapter 2 shows that corporate sector vulnerabilities are already elevated in several systemically important economies as a result of rising debt burdens and weakening debt service capacity. in a material economic slowdown scenario, half as severe as the global financial crisis, corporate debt-at-risk (debt owed by firms that are unable to cover their interest expenses with their earnings) could rise to $19 trillion—or nearly 40 percent of total corporate debt in major economies—above crisis levels.very low rates are prompting investors to search for yield and take on riskier and more illiquid assets to generate targeted returns, as discussed in chapter 3. vulnerabilities among nonbank financial institutions are now elevated in 80 percent of economies with systemically important financial sectors (by gdp). this share is similar to that at the height of the global financial crisis. vulnerabilities also remain high in the insurance sector. institutional investors’ search for yield could lead to exposures that may amplify shocks during market stress: similarities in investment funds’ portfolios could magnify a market sell-off, pension funds’ illiquid investments could constrain their abil-ity to play a role in stabilizing markets as they have done in the past, and cross-border investments by life insurers could facilitate spillovers across markets.capital flows to emerging markets have also been spurred by low interest rates in advanced econo-mies (see chapter 4). these inflows of capital have supported additional borrowing: median external debt in emerging market economies has risen to 160 percent of exports from 100 percent in 2008. in some countries, this ratio has increased to more than 300 percent. in the event of a sharp tightening in global financial conditions, increased borrowing could raise rollover and debt sustainability risks. for example, some overindebted state-owned enterprises may find it harder to maintain market access and service their liabilities without sovereign support. the october 2019 global financial stability report at a glancekey vulnerabilities in

the risk of future debt distress.regulation put in place in the wake of the global financial crisis has improved the overall resilience of the banking sector, but pockets of weaker institutions remain. negative yields and flatter yield curves—along with a more subdued growth outlook—have reduced expectations of bank profitability, and the market capitalization of some banks has fallen to low levels. banks are also exposed to sectors with high vulner-abilities through their lending activities, leaving them susceptible to potential losses. in china, the authorities had to intervene in three regional banks. among non-us banks, us dollar funding fragilities—which were a cause of significant stress during the global financial crisis—remain a source of vulnerability in many econo-mies, as discussed in chapter 5. this dollar funding fragility could amplify the impact of a tightening in funding conditions and could create spillovers to coun-tries that borrow in us dollars from non-us banks.environmental, social, and governance (esg) principles are becoming increasingly important for borrowers and investors. esg factors could have a material impact on corporate performance and may give rise to financial stability risks, particularly through climate-related losses. authorities have a key role to play in developing standards for esg invest-ing. this role, along with the need to close data gaps and encourage more consistent reporting, is discussed in chapter 6.against the backdrop of easy financial conditions, stretched valuations in some markets, and elevated vulnerabilities, medium-term risks to global growth and financial stability continue to be firmly skewed to the downside. macroeconomic and macroprudential poli-cies should be tailored to the particular circumstances facing each economy. in countries where economic activity remains robust but vulnerabilities are high or rising amid still easy financial conditions, policymak-ers should urgently tighten macroprudential policies, including broad-based macroprudential tools (such as the countercyclical capital buffer). in economies where macroeconomic policies are being eased in response to a deterioration in the economic outlook, but where vulnerabilities in particular sectors are still a concern, policymakers may have to use a more targeted approach to address specific pockets of vulnerability. for economies facing a significant slowdown, the focus should be on more accommodative policies, consider-ing available policy space.policymakers urgently need to take action to tackle financial vulnerabilities that could exacerbate the next economic downturn:• rising corporate debt burdens: stringent supervision of bank credit risk assessment and lending practices should be maintained. efforts should be made to increase disclosure and transparency in nonbank finance markets to enable a more comprehensive assessment of risks. in economies where overall corporate sector debt is deemed to be systemically high, in addition to sector-specific prudential tools for banks, policymakers may consider developing prudential tools for highly leveraged firms. reducing the bias in tax systems that favors debt over equity financing would also help reduce incentives for excessive borrowing.• increasing holdings of riskier and more illiquid securities by institutional investors: the oversight of nonbank financial entities should be strengthened. vulnerabilities among institutional investors can be addressed through appropriate incentives (for example, to reduce the offering of guaranteed return products), minimum solvency and liquidity stan-dards, and enhanced disclosure.• increased reliance on external borrowing by emerging and frontier market economies: indebted emerging market and frontier economies should mitigate debt sustainability risks through prudent debt man-agement practices and strong debt management frameworks.global policy coordination remains critical. there is a need to resolve trade tensions, as discussed in the april 2019 world economic outlook. policymakers should also complete and fully implement the global regulatory reform

notably in the united states. after sharp declines in the fourth quarter of 2018, financial markets rebounded strongly in early 2019 on growing optimism about us-china trade negotiations and as major central banks adopted a more patient and flex-ible approach to monetary policy normalization. such a dovish shift in the outlook for monetary policy in advanced economies has helped sustain positive market sentiment despite growing signs of weakening global growth (as discussed in the april 2019 world economic outlook).with financial conditions still accommodative, vulnerabilities continue to build. the tightening in financial conditions in the fourth quarter of 2018 was too short-lived to meaningfully slow the buildup of vulnerabilities, leaving medium-term risks to global financial stability broadly unchanged. financial vulner-abilities are currently elevated in the sovereign, corpo-rate, and nonbank financial sectors in several systemic countries. as the credit cycle matures, corporate sector vulnerabilities— which appear elevated in about 70 percent of systemically important countries (by gdp)—could amplify an economic downturn. this report presents a new framework for com-prehensive assessment of balance sheet vulnerabilities across financial and nonfinancial sectors, and focuses on a number of specific vulnerabilities in advanced and emerging market economies.• corporate sector debt in advanced economies: debt- service capacity has improved in most advanced economies, and balance sheets appear strong enough to sustain a moderate economic slowdown or a gradual tightening of financial conditions. however, overall debt and financial risk taking have increased, and the creditworthiness of some borrowers has deteriorated. as a result, the stock of lower-rated investment-grade (bbb) bonds has quadrupled, and the stock of speculative-grade credits has almost dou-bled in the united states and the euro area since the crisis. therefore, a significant economic downturn or sharp tightening of financial conditions could lead to a notable repricing of credit risk and could strain the debt-service capacity of indebted firms. if monetary and financial conditions remain easy, debt will likely rise further in the absence of policy action, raising the specter of a deeper downturn in the future. • the sovereign–financial sector nexus in the euro area: fiscal challenges in italy have rekindled worries about the sovereign–financial sector nexus. bank capital ratios are now higher in the euro area. but potential losses on nonperforming loans and mark-to-market declines in the value of government bonds could result in a significant hit to capital for some banks. insurance companies could also become entangled in the nexus, given their significant hold-ings of sovereign, bank, and corporate bonds. there is a risk that strains in the financial sector could yet again be passed on to companies and households, hurting economic growth.• china’s financial imbalances and potential spillovers: financial vulnerabilities in china remain high, and the authorities face a difficult trade-off between sup-porting near-term growth, countering adverse external shocks, and containing leverage through regulatory tightening. small and medium-size banks remain weak, weighing on financing conditions for smaller firms. yet further monetary and credit easing may increase vulnerabilities, as continued credit growth could slow or impede bank balance sheet repair and exacerbate existing biases in credit allocation. mean-while, china’s importance for other emerging markets will continue to increase with its inclusion in bench-mark indices; portfolio flows to china are expected to rise by as much as $150 billion by 2020 as a result of its inclusion in a global bond index. • volatile portfolio flows to emerging markets: portfolio flows to emerging markets are increasingly influ-enced by benchmark-driven investors. the

cycleces. given that benchmark-driven investors are more sensitive to changes in global financial conditions than other investors, the benefits of index member-ship may be tempered by financial stability risks for some countries. as these investors become a larger share of portfolio flows, external shocks may propa-gate to medium-size emerging and frontier market economies faster than in the past. • house prices at risk (har): the recent rapid increase in house prices in many countries has raised con-cerns about the possibility of a price correction. a new house prices-at-risk framework, presented in chapter 2 of this report, is used to quantify downside risks to house price growth. lower house price momentum, overvaluation, excessive credit growth, and tighter financial conditions help predict downside risks to house prices up to three years ahead. in turn, the measure of house prices at risk helps forecast downside risks to gdp growth and predict financial crises. the most recent data point to increased downside risks to house prices over the next one to three years in some countries.looking ahead, there is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. this will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater financial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond to shocks. possible triggers include the following: • a sharper-than-expected growth slowdown could lead to tighter financial conditions as risk asset prices fall, reflecting a weaker outlook for corporate earnings, even as policies turn more accommodative. • an unexpected shift to a less dovish outlook for mon-etary policy in advanced economies could trigger a repricing in markets, especially if investors realize that they have taken too benign a view on the mon-etary policy stance. • political and policy risks, such as an escalation of trade tensions or a no-deal brexit, could affect mar-ket sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. amid rising downside risks to global growth, policy-makers should aim to avoid a sharper economic slow-down, while keeping financial vulnerabilities in check: • policymakers should clearly communicate any reassessment of the monetary policy stance that reflects either changes in the economic outlook or risks surrounding the outlook. this will help avoid unnecessary swings in financial markets or unduly compressed market volatility. • in countries with high or rising financial vulner-abilities, policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools or expand their macroprudential toolkits where needed. these countries would benefit from activating or tightening broad-based macro-prudential measures, such as countercyclical capital buffers, to increase the financial system’s resilience. efforts should also focus on developing prudential tools to address rising corporate debt from nonbank financial intermediaries and maturity and liquid-ity mismatches in the nonbank sector. regulators should also ensure that more comprehensive stress tests (that include macro-financial feedback effects) are conducted for banks and nonbank lenders. • measures to repair public and private balance sheets should be stepped up. a gradual fiscal adjustment is needed to reduce elevated risks, based on policies that will support medium-term growth. efforts to tackle nonperforming loans on euro area bank bal-ance sheets should continue. given concerns about the sovereign–financial sector nexus, consideration could be given to mitigating concentration risk in banks’ sovereign exposures.• emerging market economies should ensure resilience against foreign portfolio outflows by reducing excessive external liabilities, cutting reliance on short-term debt, and maintaining adequate fiscal and foreign exchange reserve buffers. given the rising impor-tance of benchmark-driven portfolio flows, a close dialogue is needed between index providers, the investment community, and regulators. building on the progress achieved so far, the chinese authori-ties should continue financial sector de-risking and deleveraging policies and put greater emphasis on addressing bank vulnerabilities. structural reforms such as reducing the emphasis on growth targets and tightening budget constraints for chinese state-owned enterprises will be critical to reduce credit misallocation.']\",\n",

to keep monetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in markets. in emerging market economies, progress on lowering inflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early

taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-etary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. emerging markets such as chile, hungary, india, mexico, and poland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-tent with the appreciation of most major emerging market currencies in

fund | october 2023 xisoft landing or abrupt awakening?with core inflation still high and declining only slowly in many advanced economies, central banks may need to keep monetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in markets. in emerging market economies, progress on lowering inflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early rate hikes becoming apparent. however, there are discrepancies across regions. widening divergence of inflation and economic outlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of the global monetary policy. yet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, whereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is avoided, has fueled asset valuation since the april 2023 global financial stability report. despite the declines in equity prices since september, driven by rising long-term real rates, finan-cial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net (figure es.1). taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-etary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. emerging markets such as chile, hungary, india, mexico, and poland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-tent with the appreciation of most major emerging market currencies in the first half of the year. upside surprises to the inflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, resulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. while acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, a weak tail of banks remains in some countries. in addition, cracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could turn into worrisome fault lines. in the event of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of the global finan-cial system. most notably, the global credit cycle has started to turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and credit growth slows. the imf’s growth-at-risk measure summa-rizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in april 2023 (figure es.2). in a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing does not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and financial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the growth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more firmly skewed to the downside.united stateseuro areaother advanced economieschinaemerging markets excluding

accumulated during the pan-demic to shore up their balance sheets and interest payments. however, these factors may not be sufficient to stave off a trend of rising repayment difficulties. indeed, the share of firms with low cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with fewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including in emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions (figure es.3). this rebound is especially evident among small and medium firms. likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue to face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in housing activity and a further decline in home prices. global real house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major central banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. in advanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller decline of about 2.4 percent. countries with a large share of floating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic average recorded double-digit declines in home prices.given the size and concentration of commercial real estate (cre) and its strong connections with the broader financial system and the real economy, stress in that sector can have significant financial stability implications. as a share of gdp , cre-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of gdp in europe and 18 percent in the united states. concerns about the risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding sources become less available for cre borrowers needing to refi-nance—banks have reported tighter lending standards, private equity fundraising activity has slowed sharply (figure es.4), and the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has gone tepid. the prospect of interest rates remaining higher for longer, combined with declining property valuations, will keep refinancing conditions strained in the cre sector.in china, weakening economic momentum, a deepening property sector downturn, and growing strains on local gov-ernment financing weigh heavily on market sentiment. the renminbi has faced notable downward pressure as equity prices have fallen sharply. disinflationary pressures have grown, prompting the people’s bank of china to cut policy rates—one of the few central banks to ease monetary policy. however, such easing and other announced stimulus measures have not yet restored confidence among businesses, consumers, and, impor-tantly, homebuyers. stronger private property developers and even state-owned developers have experienced materially

investment funds with shorter funding structures, especially those providing daily liquidity, could face redemption pressure from their investors, as higher interest rates reduce the value of their fixed-income assets. those using leveraged investment strategies predicated on swift disinflation may be forced to unwind positions should inflation stay doggedly high.chapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies (emdes) are estimated to reach about $2 trillion per year. the private sector is key to financing the required investments in emdes, given limited fis-cal space and challenging market conditions. by 2030, the share of private finance must increase to about 80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in emdes, and the proportion should be even greater in emdes outside of china (figure es.8). policy recommendationsultimately, sustainable economic growth requires both price and financial stability. central banks must remain determined in their fight against inflation until there is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably toward targets, although the stance of monetary policy should reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy frame-work, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combi-nations depend on the nature of the shock and country-specific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehen-sive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mis-matches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate mini-mum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in residential real estate prices on household balance sheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions. con-tinued vigilance is warranted to monitor vulnerabilities international monetary fund | october 2023 xisoft landing or abrupt

reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy frame-work, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combi-nations depend on the nature of the shock and country-specific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehen-sive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mis-matches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate mini-mum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in residential real estate prices on household balance sheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions. con-tinued vigilance is warranted to monitor vulnerabilities international monetary fund | october 2023 xvin the cre sector, including reviews of banks’ cre valuations, and ensure that provisions are adequate. buffers should be built to help guard against future losses and to support the continued provision of credit during stress times. for example, authorities may raise countercyclical capital buffers or sectoral systemic risk buffers if circumstances allow. to avoid procyclical effects, the raising of buffers should be conditioned on the absence of signs that credit is already being constrained by the adequacy of banks’ capital.a broad mix of structural and financial policies is needed to create an attractive investment environment for private capital to support climate finance needs in emdes. a stronger climate information architecture—data, disclosures, and alignment approaches (including taxonomies)—is necessary to attract private investors. financial sector policies should be focused on creating climate impact. t ransition taxonomies in emdes can help institutions identify activities that may reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time, including in the most carbon-intensive sectors. disclosures and labels for sustainable investment funds should enhance market transparency, market integrity, and alignment with climate impact–oriented outcomes. through its convening power, the imf has a crucial role to play in mobilizing private climate finance, particularly in lower-income countries. the resilience and sustain-ability facility can be a catalyst for private finance through its policy conditionality, supporting reforms that can help attract private capital.']\",\n",

for banks with concentrated deposit bases and large mark-to-market losses (figure es.3). in europe, the impact was greatest on banks that trade at significant discounts to their book values, in which there are long-term concerns regarding profitability and their ability to raise capital. emerging market banks appear to have avoided significant losses in their securities portfolios so far, while deposit funding has been stable. imf staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in europe, japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (figure es.4). that said, many countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and emerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. in addition, emerging market banks generally play a larger role in the financial system than in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. these events have been a reminder that funding can disappear rapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. these concerns are particularly pertinent for us regional banks. with the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of us banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real gdp by 44 basis points, all else being equal.the challenges aheadthe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (figure es.5). they now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.after having significantly increased their securities holdings during the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. this normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. in the united states, for example, net issuance of the us t reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while

financial stability report: safeguarding financial stability amid high inflation and geopolitical risksxiv international monetary fund | april 2023tightening is reducing the share absorbed by the federal reserve’s balance sheet (figure es.6).the impact of tighter monetary and financial conditions could be amplified because of financial leverage, mismatches in asset and liability liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness within the nbfi sector and with traditional banking institu-tions. for example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (figure es.7).large emerging markets have so far managed relatively smoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. however, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. sovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen around the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. there are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (figure es.8).in frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 and may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (figure es.9). low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. they continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. looking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-lated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. however, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. the steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (figure es.10). concerns have been growing about conditions in the com-mercial real estate (cre) market, which

losses on interest rate–sensitive assets led to the banking sell-off, especially for banks with concentrated deposit bases and large mark-to-market losses (figure es.3). in europe, the impact was greatest on banks that trade at significant discounts to their book values, in which there are long-term concerns regarding profitability and their ability to raise capital. emerging market banks appear to have avoided significant losses in their securities portfolios so far, while deposit funding has been stable. imf staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in europe, japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (figure es.4). that said, many countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and emerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. in addition, emerging market banks generally play a larger role in the financial system than in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. these events have been a reminder that funding can disappear rapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. these concerns are particularly pertinent for us regional banks. with the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of us banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real gdp by 44 basis points, all else being equal.the challenges aheadthe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (figure es.5). they now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.after having significantly increased their securities holdings during the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. this normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. in the united states, for example, net issuance of the us t reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while quantitative united stateseuropejapanemerging marketsfigure es.4. equity impact of unrealized losses on

federal reserve’s balance sheet (figure es.6).the impact of tighter monetary and financial conditions could be amplified because of financial leverage, mismatches in asset and liability liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness within the nbfi sector and with traditional banking institu-tions. for example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (figure es.7).large emerging markets have so far managed relatively smoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. however, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. sovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen around the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. there are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (figure es.8).in frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 and may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (figure es.9). low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. they continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. looking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-lated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. however, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. the steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (figure es.10). concerns have been growing about conditions in the com-mercial real estate (cre) market, which

asset quality would have significant repercus -sions both for their profitability and bank lending appetite. in addition, nbfis play an important role in the real estate invest-ment trusts (reits) sector and commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, so there are broader implications stemming from stress in the cre market, both for financial stability and for economic growth. global transaction activity has decreased by 17 percent from the previous year, and reits have seen price corrections up to 20 percent. losses have been particularly elevated in the office sector, as demand and occupancy rates are more anemic in the post-pandemic environment. for firms, default rates have remained low, as the sector’s substantial cash buffers built during the pandemic have pro-vided financial cushioning (figure es.11). however, declining corporate earnings and tighter funding conditions have started to erode these buffers and could lead to repayment difficulties down the road and expose firms to defaults. small firms and emerging market corporates would likely be more adversely affected because they lack alternative sources of financing to bank lending, the standards of which have already started to tighten.china’s housing market remains sluggish despite its reopen-ing. although financing conditions have improved for some property developers, home buyers continue to avoid purchas-ing from weaker private developers, underscoring the limited progress in restoring confidence in the broader housing market. concerns about debt sustainability of local government financial vehicles (lgfvs)—which are heavily involved in the property market—intensified in 2022; with total lgfv debt estimated at about 50 percent of china’s gdp , a broadening of lgfv debt distress could impose significant losses on some banks, particu-larly in low-income regions with higher local government debt and large stocks of unfinished housing (figure es.12). chapter 2 shows that nbfis are increasingly interconnected with banks globally (figure es.13). case studies show that non-bank financial intermediary stress tends to emerge with elevated leverage, poor liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness, and that it can spill across jurisdictions, including to emerging market and developing economies. these vulnerabilities may be heightened in the current high-inflation environment, as the provision of liquidity by central banks for financial stability purposes becomes more challenging, including from a commu-nications standpoint, and it could undermine the fight against inflation.chapter 3 documents how rising geopolitical tensions among major economies could raise financial stability risks by increas-ing global economic and financial fragmentation and

risks have risen significantly as the resil-ience of the global financial system has faced a number of severe tests since the october 2022 global financial stability report. in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, amid extremely low interest rates, compressed volatility, and ample liquidity, market participants increased their exposures to liquidity, duration, and credit risk, often employing financial leverage to boost returns—vulnerabilities repeatedly flagged in previous issues of the global financial stability report. the sudden failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank in the united states, and the loss of market confidence in credit suisse, a global systemically important bank (gsib) in europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities. amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the us banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (figure es.1). it also led to a significant repricing of monetary policy rate expec-tations, with magnitude and scale comparable to that of black monday in 1987 (figure es.2). the forceful response by policymakers to stem systemic risks reduced market anxiety. in the united states, bank regulators took steps to guarantee uninsured deposits at the two failed institutions and to provide liquidity through a new bank term funding program to prevent further bank runs. in switzerland, the swiss national bank provided emergency liquidity support to credit suisse, which was then taken over by ubs in a state-supported acquisition. but market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system.the fundamental question confronting market participants and policymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan -cial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. while there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (nbfis). s&p 500silicon valley bank financial groupus banks euro stoxx 600credit suisseeuropean banksfigure es.1. performance of

internal risk management practices with respect to interest rate and liquidity risks at banks, as well as supervisory lapses. supervisors should ensure that banks have corporate governance and risk

should close data gaps, incentiv-ize proper risk management practices, set appropriate regulation, and intensify supervision.adequate minimum capital and liquidity requirements includ-ing for smaller institutions that, individually, are not considered systemic, are essential to contain financial stability risks. pru-dential rules should ensure that banks hold capital for interest rate risk and

ratesfinancial stability risks have risen significantly as the resil-ience of the global financial system has faced a number of severe tests since the october 2022 global financial stability report. in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, amid extremely low interest rates, compressed volatility, and ample liquidity, market participants increased their exposures to liquidity, duration, and credit risk, often employing financial leverage to boost returns—vulnerabilities repeatedly flagged in previous issues of the global financial stability report. the sudden failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank in the united states, and the loss of market confidence in credit suisse, a global systemically important bank (gsib) in europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities. amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the us banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (figure es.1). it also led to a significant repricing of monetary policy rate expec-tations, with magnitude and scale comparable to that of black monday in 1987 (figure es.2). the forceful response by policymakers to stem systemic risks reduced market anxiety. in the united states, bank regulators took steps to guarantee uninsured deposits at the two failed institutions and to provide liquidity through a new bank term funding program to prevent further bank runs. in switzerland, the swiss national bank provided emergency liquidity support to credit suisse, which was then taken over by ubs in a state-supported acquisition. but market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system.the fundamental question confronting market participants and policymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan -cial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. while there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (nbfis). s&p 500silicon valley bank financial groupus banks euro stoxx 600credit suisseeuropean

about losses on interest rate–sensitive assets led to the banking sell-off, especially for banks with concentrated deposit bases and large mark-to-market losses (figure es.3). in europe, the impact was greatest on banks that trade at significant discounts to their book values, in which there are long-term concerns regarding profitability and their ability to raise capital. emerging market banks appear to have avoided significant losses in their securities portfolios so far, while deposit funding has been stable. imf staff estimates that the impact on regula-tory ratios of unrealized losses in held-to-maturity portfolios for the median bank in europe, japan, and emerging mar-kets would likely be modest, although the impact for some other banks could be material (figure es.4). that said, many countries have low levels of deposit insurance coverage, and emerging market banks generally have assets with lower credit quality than in advanced economies. in addition, emerging market banks generally play a larger role in the financial system than in advanced economies, so the consequences of banking sector distress could be more severe. these events have been a reminder that funding can disappear rapidly amid widespread loss of confidence. shifting patterns of deposits across different institutions could raise funding costs for banks which could restrict their ability to provide credit to the economy. these concerns are particularly pertinent for us regional banks. with the recent fall in bank equity prices, lending capacity of us banks could decline by almost 1 percent in the coming year, reducing real gdp by 44 basis points, all else being equal.the challenges aheadthe emergence of stress in financial markets is complicating the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated. before the recent stress episodes, interest rates in advanced economies had risen sharply and were more aligned with central bank communications about the need to keep monetary policy restrictive for longer. since then, investors have sharply repriced downward the expected path of monetary policy in advanced economies (figure es.5). they now anticipate central banks to begin easing monetary policy well in advance of what was previously forecast. inflation, however, has remained uncomfortably well above target.after having significantly increased their securities holdings during the pandemic, central banks have started to reduce their balance sheets. this normalization process could pose challenges for sovereign debt markets at a time when liquidity is generally poor, debt levels are high, and additional supply of sovereign debt will have to be absorbed by private investors. in the united states, for example, net issuance of the us t reasury securities is projected to increase in 2023 and 2024, while quantitative united stateseuropejapanemerging marketsfigure es.4. equity impact of unrealized losses on

financial stability report: safeguarding financial stability amid high inflation and geopolitical risksxiv international monetary fund | april 2023tightening is reducing the share absorbed by the federal reserve’s balance sheet (figure es.6).the impact of tighter monetary and financial conditions could be amplified because of financial leverage, mismatches in asset and liability liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness within the nbfi sector and with traditional banking institu-tions. for example, in an effort to increase returns, life insurance companies have doubled their illiquid investments over the last decade and also make increasing use of leverage to fund illiquid assets (figure es.7).large emerging markets have so far managed relatively smoothly the sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies, in part aided by the fact that global financial condi-tions have not matched the extent of global monetary policy tightening. however, they could face significant challenges should current strains in financial markets fail to subside and cause a pullback from global risk taking and associated capital outflows. sovereign debt sustainability metrics continue to worsen around the world, especially in frontier and low-income coun-tries, with many of the most vulnerable already facing severe strains. there are now 12 sovereigns trading at distressed spreads and an additional 20 at spreads of more than 700 basis points, a level at which market access has historically been very challeng-ing (figure es.8).in frontier markets, brisk debt issuance evaporated in 2021 and may not resume at the same scale, given ongoing challenges with sovereign defaults and macro vulnerabilities (figure es.9). low-income countries have been significantly affected by high food and energy prices, have little to no access to market financ-ing, and have concerns about the availability of official conces-sional financing. they continue to face extremely challenging debt conditions, with more than half (37 out of 69) in, or at high risk of, debt distress. looking beyond financial institutions, households accumu-lated significant savings during the pandemic thanks in part to the fiscal support and monetary easing rolled out during the pandemic. however, they are facing heavier debt-servicing burdens, eroding their savings and leaving them more vulner-able to default. the steep increase of residential mortgage rates has cooled global housing demand. average house prices fell in 60 percent of the emerging markets in the second half of 2022, while in advanced economies price increases have slowed. economies with larger shares of adjustable-rate mortgages have recorded the largest declines in real prices. valuations remain stretched in many countries, increasing the risk of a sharp price correction if interest rates rise quickly (figure es.10). concerns have been growing about conditions in the com-mercial real estate (cre) market, which has been under pressure from a worsening of fundamentals and tighter funding costs. in the united states, banks with total assets less than $250 billion structured creditprivate commercial

asset quality would have significant repercus -sions both for their profitability and bank lending appetite. in addition, nbfis play an important role in the real estate invest-ment trusts (reits) sector and commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, so there are broader implications stemming from stress in the cre market, both for financial stability and for economic growth. global transaction activity has decreased by 17 percent from the previous year, and reits have seen price corrections up to 20 percent. losses have been particularly elevated in the office sector, as demand and occupancy rates are more anemic in the post-pandemic environment. for firms, default rates have remained low, as the sector’s substantial cash buffers built during the pandemic have pro-vided financial cushioning (figure es.11). however, declining corporate earnings and tighter funding conditions have started to erode these buffers and could lead to repayment difficulties down the road and expose firms to defaults. small firms and emerging market corporates would likely be more adversely affected because they lack alternative sources of financing to bank lending, the standards of which have already started to tighten.china’s housing market remains sluggish despite its reopen-ing. although financing conditions have improved for some property developers, home buyers continue to avoid purchas-ing from weaker private developers, underscoring the limited progress in restoring confidence in the broader housing market. concerns about debt sustainability of local government financial vehicles (lgfvs)—which are heavily involved in the property market—intensified in 2022; with total lgfv debt estimated at about 50 percent of china’s gdp , a broadening of lgfv debt distress could impose significant losses on some banks, particu-larly in low-income regions with higher local government debt and large stocks of unfinished housing (figure es.12). chapter 2 shows that nbfis are increasingly interconnected with banks globally (figure es.13). case studies show that non-bank financial intermediary stress tends to emerge with elevated leverage, poor liquidity, and high levels of interconnectedness, and that it can spill across jurisdictions, including to emerging market and developing economies. these vulnerabilities may be heightened in the current high-inflation environment, as the provision of liquidity by central banks for financial stability purposes becomes more challenging, including from a commu-nications standpoint, and it could undermine the fight against inflation.chapter 3 documents how rising geopolitical tensions among major economies could raise financial stability risks by increas-ing global economic and financial fragmentation and adversely affect the cross-border allocation of capital (figure es.14). this could cause capital flows to suddenly reverse and could threaten price to incomepermitsmortgage cost indexfigure es.10.

liquidity should be provided to counterparties that are compelled by supervision and regulation to internalize liquidity risk (the “stick”) so that central banks may need to intervene only to address systemic liquidity risks (the “carrot”). a significant part of the risk should remain in the marketplace (“partial insurance”) to minimize moral hazard, and interventions should have a well-defined end date allowing market forces to reassert themselves once acute strains subside.some of the recent responses by policymakers suggest that further work is needed on the resolution reform agenda to increase the likelihood that systemic banks can be resolved without putting public funds at risk. while it is a positive development that sharehold-ers and holders of other capital instruments incurred losses, allocating more losses across the creditor hierarchy before public funds are put at risk is proving harder to deliver. the international community will need to take stock of these experiences and draw policy conclusions on the effectiveness of resolution reforms after the global financial crisis. according to the imf’s integrated policy frame-work, foreign exchange interventions may be appropri-ate in the case of illiquid foreign exchange markets, balance sheet mismatches, and weakly anchored infla-tion expectation, so long as reserves are sufficient and intervention does not impair the credibility of mac-roeconomic policies or substitute for their necessary adjustment. in case of imminent crises, capital outflow measures may be an option to lessen outflow pres-sures, although they should be part of a comprehensive policy package that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and be lifted once crisis conditions abate.sovereign borrowers in developing economies and frontier markets should enhance efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, includ-ing through early contact with their creditors, multi-lateral cooperation, and support from the international community. enacting credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans could help contain borrowing costs and alleviate debt sustainability concerns. for countries near debt distress, bilateral and private sector creditors should coordinate on preemptive restructuring, using the g20 common framework where applicable.providing nonbank financial institutions with direct access to central bank liquidity could prove necessary in times of stress, but implementing appropriate guard-rails is paramount. as a first line of defense, robust surveillance, regulation, and supervision of nonbank financial institutions are vital. if financial stability is threatened, situationally appropriate central bank liquidity support for nonbank financial institutions can be considered—discretionary marketwide operations, standing lending facilities, or lender of last resort—but such support needs to be carefully designed to avoid moral hazard. policymakers should devote resources to assess-ing, managing, and mitigating financial stability risks caused by geopolitical tensions rising. financial institu-tions may need to hold adequate capital and liquidity buffers to mitigate such geopolitical risks. policy makers should also ensure that the global financial safety net is adequate. given the significant risks to global macro-financial stability, multilateral efforts should be strengthened to diplomatically resolve geopo-litical tensions and prevent economic and financial fragmentation.30082_00_fm.indd 17 09/04/2023

scale up private finance in the transition to a greener economy; and con-tinue to strengthen the climate finance information architecture.policymakers should develop comprehensive global standards for crypto assets along the activity and risk spectrum. a more robust oversight of fintech firms and decentralized finance (defi) platforms is needed to take advantage of their benefits while mitigating their risks. to preserve the effectiveness of capital flow management measures in an environment of growing usage of crypto assets, policymakers need to pursue a multifaceted policy strategy. recent measures taken in markets and exchanges in response to elevated volatility in commodity prices highlight the need for regulators to examine the broader implications, including exchange governance mechanisms, resiliency of trading systems, concentration of risk, margin setting, and trading transparency in exchange and over-the-counter markets.share in productionprice change between february 23 and march 23, 2022 (right scale)figure 10. russia’s share in global production(percent)018246810121416–10–50510152025303540aluminum copper nickel coal platinum oil gassources: us geological survey, national minerals information center;

chinese banks: debt spreads(basis points, subordinated debt) international monetary fund | april 2021 xia more granular firm-level assessment finds that there are notable differences in performance across sectors and firm sizes. imf staff analysis suggests that liquidity stress is high at small firms in most sectors and across countries, while solvency stress is high at small firms but also notable at mid-sized and even large firms in the most affected sectors (figure 9). chapter 1 proposes a framework to assess whether firms should rely on market financing, seek government support, or be restructured or liquidated. the crisis has hit the commercial real estate sector hard (see chapter\\\\xa03). commercial property transactions and prices slumped in 2020 (figure 10). part of the adverse impact on the retail, office, and hotel segments could be structural, as some activities increasingly take place virtu-ally or are relocating outside of large cities. in the event of a structural decline in demand, commercial real estate fair values could drop sharply: a permanent increase in the vacancy rate by 5 percentage points is estimated to result, on average, in a drop in fair values by about 15 percent after five years (figure 11). since the pandemic, price mis-alignments appear to have increased. this development, if it persists, could pose downside risks to growth. banks came into the pandemic with high capital and liquidity buffers, thanks to regulatory reforms imple-mented after the 2007–08 financial crisis, and they have been resilient so far. but the extent to which they will continue to provide credit through the recovery is an open question. while growth of loans, particularly to businesses, has slowed in some countries, loan demand is expected to firm up once the recovery gains strength, especially where it has been weakest. but loan officers in most coun-tries do not anticipate a loosening in lending standards (figure\\\\xa012). the phasing out of support policies could have a significant impact on some banks, likely weighing on their appetite for lending. moreover, for most banks, uncertainties about credit losses and weak prospects for profitability are likely to discourage significant reduction in capital buffers to support the recovery. such constraints may be particularly worrisome for firms with limited financing options that are more dependent on bank credit. authorities should continue to encourage banks to use buffers, where prudent, to support the recovery.ongoing policy support remains essential until a sustainable and inclusive recovery takes hold to maintain the flow of credit to the economy and prevent the pan-demic from posing a threat to the global financial system. monetary policy will need to remain accommodative until mandated policy objectives are achieved. policymakers should act swiftly to prevent financial vulnerabilities from becoming entrenched and turning into legacy problems.

financial stability risks. but actions taken during the pandemic may have unintended consequences such as stretched valuations and rising financial vulnerabilities. the recovery is expected to be asynchronous and divergent between advanced and emerging market economies. given large external financing needs, emerging markets face daunting challenges, especially if a persistent rise in us rates brings about a repricing of risk and tighter financial conditions. the corporate sector in many countries is emerging from the pandemic over-indebted, with notable differences depending on firm size and sector. concerns about the credit quality of hard-hit borrowers and the profitability outlook are likely to weigh on the risk appetite of banks during the recovery. there is a pressing need to act to avoid a legacy of vulnerabilities. policymakers should take early action and tighten selected macroprudential policy tools while avoiding a broad tighten-ing of financial conditions. they should also support balance sheet repair to foster a sustainable and inclusive recovery.thanks to massive policy support, the global financial system has been resilient during the covid-19 pan-demic and financial conditions have eased significantly (figure\\\\xa01). this has helped maintain the flow of credit to households and firms, facilitated the recovery, and kept financial risks at bay. the improved economic outlook has clearly reduced the range of adverse outcomes, but notable downside risks to future gdp growth remain.t wo overarching themes are emerging. first, unprec-edented policy support may have unintended conse-quences: excessive risk taking in markets is contributing to stretched valuations, and rising financial vulnerabilities may become structural legacy problems if not addressed. equity markets have rallied aggressively since the third quarter of 2020 on expectations of a rapid economic recovery and continued policy backstops, and they are now trading at levels meaningfully higher than those suggested by models based on fundamentals (figure 2). while earnings expectations have improved, historically low real risk-free rates (despite most recent increases) have provided material support so far to valuations. in the cor-porate bond market, spreads have remained very tight. long-term interest rates have increased significantly, especially in the united states, reflecting in part greater investor confidence in the outlook (figure 3). while a global financial stability report: preempting a legacy of vulnerabilitiesx international monetary fund | april 2021gradual rise in rates on the back of improving funda-mentals may be welcome, a rapid and persistent increase, especially in real rates, may result in a repricing of risk in markets and a sudden tightening in financial conditions. such a tightening could interact with elevated financial vulnerabilities, with repercussions for confidence and endangering macro-financial stability, especially in emerg-ing markets.second, the recovery is expected to be asynchronous and divergent across economies (see the april 2021 world economic outlook). there is a risk that financial condi-tions in emerging market economies may tighten mark-edly, especially if policymakers in advanced economies take steps toward policy normalization. a less favorable financial environment may result in large portfolio out-flows and pose a significant challenge to some emerging and frontier market economies, given the large financ-ing needs they face this year. imf staff analysis points to a continued improvement in the outlook for portfolio flows, primarily reflecting easier global financial condi-tions (figure 4). nevertheless, countries with weaker fundamentals or limited access to covid-19 vaccines are vulnerable. the sovereign-bank nexus has worsened in emerging markets as domestic banks have absorbed the bulk of increases in domestic debt (figure 5). for many frontier market economies, market access remains impaired. china has recovered more rapidly than other countries, but at the cost of a further buildup in vulnerabilities, particularly risky corporate debt. financial conditions may become less favorable amid expectations for policy tightening and new measures to impose discipline on banks, local governments, and property developers, as well as rising uncertainty about implicit guarantees. fund-ing conditions for capital instruments have tightened for weaker, smaller banks (figure\\\\xa06). national authorities face a delicate but urgent challenge in unwinding implicit guarantees—a task that must be handled delicately given the potential for disorderly repricing.the global corporate sector has been hit hard by the pandemic. extraordinary policy support has helped miti-gate its impact. large firms with market access have taken advantage of favorable conditions to issue debt and cope with liquidity pressures (figures 7 and 8). but the buildup in corporate

large mid-sized smalladvanced economies emerging market economiesglobal financial stability report: preempting a legacy of vulnerabilitiesxii international monetary fund | april 2021taking into consideration possible lags between the acti-vation and impact of macroprudential tools, policymakers should take early action.they should tighten selected macroprudential policy tools to tackle pockets of elevated vulnerability while avoid-ing a broad tightening of financial conditions. if such tools are not available (such as in some segments of the non-bank financial intermediation sector), policymakers should swiftly develop them. given the challenges to designing and operationalizing macroprudential tools within existing frameworks, policymakers should also consider building buffers elsewhere to protect the financial system. in emerging and frontier market economies, countries with market access should take advantage of favorable financ-ing conditions to improve the composition of their debt structure. countries with limited market access will likely need additional assistance from the international commu-nity. other countries facing significant difficulties with debt burdens could benefit from deeper restructuring. the group of t wenty (g20) common framework for debt t reatments can help address debt vulnerabilities. rebuilding buffers, where possible, should be a key priority to prepare for any sudden price adjustments and reversal of capital flows.repairing corporate balance sheets should be a priority to enable a sustainable and inclusive recovery. direct and firm-specific targeted policy support may be needed for viable firms whose market access is limited and that are facing temporary liquidity or solvency risks. given very limited fiscal resources in some jurisdictions, policymak-ers should also expedite reforms to enhance resolution frameworks, including the development of distressed debt and nonperforming loan markets.once the extent of structural changes in the commer-cial real estate sector becomes clearer, targeted macropru-dential policy tools (such as limits on the loan-to-value or debt-service-coverage ratios) should be deployed to reduce downside risks to growth. the optimal timing of such policy measures should depend on the economy-specific pace of the recovery and the degree of financial vulner-abilities in the commercial real estate sector. broadening the macroprudential toolkit to cover nonbank financial institutions active in some commercial real estate funding markets will also be crucial.in the financial sector, regulatory guidance on provi-sioning for expected losses to avoid excessive procyclicality remains pertinent, but such provisioning should be subject to supervisory scrutiny. restrictions on capital distributions should be maintained or be relaxed only progressively in countries overcoming the pandemic, subject to supervisory stress tests to ensure that banks remain well capitalized.interquartile range medianfigure 11. response of commercial real estate prices across economies to a permanent shock to the vacancy rate(percent)sources: haver analytics; msci real estate;

policymakers have taken extraordinary measures to protect people, the economy, and the financial system. however, prospects for recovery remain highly uncertain and will depend on the availability of reliable covid-19 treatments and vaccines. in addition, many countries have entered the crisis with elevated preexisting vulnerabilities in some sectors—asset management, nonfinancial firms, and sovereigns—and vulnerabilities are rising, represent-ing potential headwinds for the recovery (figure 1). since the june 2020 global financial stability update, global financial conditions have remained accommodative on the back of continued policy sup-port. in advanced economies, low interest rates and a recovery in risk asset markets have continued to sup-port further easing in financial conditions (figure 2). financial conditions have generally eased also in emerging markets (excluding china) over the same period, although external costs for many countries are still above pre–covid-19 levels (figure 2). in china, financial conditions have remained broadly stable, as authorities have scaled back expectations for further interest rate reductions amid improving economic activ-ity and rising financial sector risks.although the sharp easing of financial conditions since late march has helped prevent a financial crisis and cushion the impact of covid-19 on the economy, the deterioration of the economic outlook has shifted the expected distribution of global growth in 2020 deeply into negative territory (figure 3). looking ahead, the global economy is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in 2021, according to the october 2020 world economic outlook (weo). this expected rebound and easy finan-cial conditions imply that the odds of negative growth next year are low, though the balance of risks is tilted to the downside (figure 3).unprecedented policy actions taken in response to the pandemic have been successful in boosting investor sentiment and maintaining the flow of credit to the economy. to cope with cash flow pressures, firms have stepped up bond issuance, tapped bank credit lines (most notably in the united states), and taken advantage of government-guaranteed loans (see chapter 3).hard currency bond issuance in emerging markets has been strong as well. aggregate portfolio flows have recovered from their march lows, though about half of emerging market economies have continued to experi-ence outflows over the past three months. easy financial conditions have improved the outlook for portfolio flows to emerging markets, with the

financial conditions (figure 2). financial conditions have generally eased also in emerging markets (excluding china) over the same period, although external costs for many countries are still above pre–covid-19 levels (figure 2). in china, financial conditions have remained broadly stable, as authorities have scaled back expectations for further interest rate reductions amid improving economic activ-ity and rising financial sector risks.although the sharp easing of financial conditions since late march has helped prevent a financial crisis and cushion the impact of covid-19 on the economy, the deterioration of the economic outlook has shifted the expected distribution of global growth in 2020 deeply into negative territory (figure 3). looking ahead, the global economy is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in 2021, according to the october 2020 world economic outlook (weo). this expected rebound and easy finan-cial conditions imply that the odds of negative growth next year are low, though the balance of risks is tilted to the downside (figure 3).unprecedented policy actions taken in response to the pandemic have been successful in boosting investor sentiment and maintaining the

rising market valuations and the evolution of the economy, discussed in the june 2020 global financial stability update, persists. for example, analysis of year-to-date us stock market performance shows that a sharp decline in the corpo-rate earnings outlook has been more than offset by lower risk-free rates and a compression of the equity risk premium, reflecting central banks’ policy rate cuts and other measures that have boosted investor sentiment despite higher economic uncertainty (see chapter\\\\xa01). similarly, the decline in corporate bond yields has been driven by the fall in risk-free rates and the compression in credit spreads—in many cases below values estimated to be consistent with economic fundamentals (figure 6). the spread compression can be partly attributed to policy support and, in the case of emerging markets, it can also be traced to policy easing by central banks in advanced economies. if mar-kets believe that policy support will be maintained or scaled up in response to deterioration in the economic outlook, current risk asset valuations could be sus-tained for some time. however, if investors reassess the scope for policy support or if the recovery is delayed, the odds of a sharp adjustment may rise. nonfinancial firms have come under significant liquid-ity strains following the covid-19 outbreak. more vulnerable firms—with weaker solvency and liquidity positions, as well as smaller firms—have experienced greater financial stress than their peers in the early stages of the crisis (see chapter\\\\xa03). to cope with cash shortages, many firms—notably those whose earnings fell short of their interest expenses—have increased their borrowing (figure 7), adding to the already high corporate debt levels in several economies (figure 8).

a sustainable recovery is delayed, liquidity pressures may morph into insolvencies.barring a significant tightening in funding conditions, large firms with access to capital markets are likely to avoid significant solvency pressures. firms in sectors most affected by the pandemic, however, are facing weaker growth prospects and greater liquidity strains, and hence a higher risk of default and insolvency. small and medium-sized enterprises, which are generally more vulnerable, could be a significant channel for transmission of the economic shock. furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises tend to dominate some of the most contact-intensive sectors (hotels, restaurants, entertainment), which have taken a beating from covid-19. banks entered the covid-19 crisis with signifi-cantly stronger capital and liquidity buffers than they had in 2008–09. this has allowed them to continue to provide credit to the economy. policies aimed at supporting borrowers and encouraging banks to use the flexibility built into the regulatory framework have likely supported banks’ willingness and ability to lend. however, some banks are already starting to tighten their lending standards, which could have adverse implications for the recovery. a forward-looking analysis of bank solvency in 29 countries (not includ-ing china) shows that in the october 2020 weo baseline scenario most banks will be able to absorb losses and maintain capital buffers above the minimum capital requirements (see chapter 4). in the weo adverse scenario characterized by a deeper recession and a weaker recovery, a sizable weak tail of banks could see their capital buffers depleted to the levels that could constrain their lending capacity (figure 9). these weak banks’ capital shortfall relative to broad regulatory requirements—which include the counter-cyclical capital buffer, capital conservation buffer, and systemic buffers—could reach $220 billion, even after accounting for borrower- and bank-oriented mitigation policies (see chapter 4).nonbank financial institutions (nbfis) have entered the crisis with elevated vulnerabilities (figure 10). they have managed to cope with the pandemic-induced market turmoil thanks to policy support, but fragilities remain high. asset managers, for example, could be forced into fire sales if portfolio losses are larger and redemptions last longer than during the march sell-off. nbfis play a growing role in credit markets, including riskier segments, and the increased links between nbfis and banks imply that fragilities could spread through the financial system.icr < 1 in 2019:q4icr < 1 in 2020:q2 and an increase in net debt between q4 and q2icr < 1 in 2020:q2figure 7. publicly listed firms: debt at risk(percent of

xiiioutflows over the next three quarters falling from about 60 percent at the peak of market turmoil to 25 percent in september (figure 4), though still above its pre–covid-19 level.global equity markets have rebounded strongly from pandemic lows, with notable differentiation across coun-tries depending on the spread of the virus, the scope of policy support, and sectoral composition. equity markets in china and the united states have outperformed other markets, driven by technology stocks (dark and light green bars, figure 5), notwithstanding the market correc-tion in september. more contact-intensive sectors (hotels, restaurants, leisure) have been hurt by lockdowns and social distancing. the underperformance of the energy and financial sectors (red and yellow bars, figure\\\\xa05) reflects investors’ assessments of weaker growth prospects.the disconnect between rising market valuations and the evolution of the economy, discussed in the june 2020 global financial stability update, persists. for example, analysis of year-to-date us stock market performance shows that a sharp decline in the corpo-rate earnings outlook has been more than offset by lower risk-free rates and a compression of the equity risk premium, reflecting central banks’ policy rate cuts and other measures that have boosted investor sentiment despite higher economic uncertainty (see chapter\\\\xa01). similarly, the decline in corporate bond yields has been driven by the fall in risk-free rates and the compression in credit spreads—in many cases below values estimated to be consistent with economic fundamentals (figure 6). the spread compression can be partly attributed to policy support and, in the case of emerging markets, it can also be traced to policy easing by central banks in advanced economies. if mar-kets believe that policy support will be maintained or scaled up in response to deterioration in the economic outlook, current risk asset valuations could be sus-tained for some time. however, if investors reassess the scope for policy support or if the recovery is delayed, the odds of a sharp adjustment may rise. nonfinancial firms have come under significant liquid-ity strains following the covid-19 outbreak. more vulnerable firms—with weaker solvency and liquidity positions, as well as smaller firms—have experienced greater financial stress than their peers in the early stages of the crisis (see chapter\\\\xa03). to cope with cash shortages, many firms—notably those whose earnings fell short of their interest expenses—have increased their borrowing (figure 7), adding to the already high corporate debt levels in several economies (figure 8). default rates have been on the rise as well. as the crisis continues to unfold,

a sustainable recovery is delayed, liquidity pressures may morph into insolvencies.barring a significant tightening in funding conditions, large firms with access to capital markets are likely to avoid significant solvency pressures. firms in sectors most affected by the pandemic, however, are facing weaker growth prospects and greater liquidity strains, and hence a higher risk of default and insolvency. small and medium-sized enterprises, which are generally more vulnerable, could be a significant channel for transmission of the economic shock. furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises tend to dominate some of the most contact-intensive sectors (hotels, restaurants, entertainment), which have taken a beating from covid-19. banks entered the covid-19 crisis with signifi-cantly stronger capital and liquidity buffers than they had in 2008–09. this has allowed them to continue to provide credit to the economy. policies aimed at supporting borrowers and encouraging banks to use the flexibility built into the regulatory framework have likely supported banks’ willingness and ability to lend. however, some banks are already starting to tighten their lending standards, which could have adverse implications for the recovery. a forward-looking analysis of bank solvency in 29 countries (not includ-ing china) shows that in the october 2020 weo baseline scenario most banks will be able to absorb losses and maintain capital buffers above the minimum capital requirements (see chapter 4). in the weo adverse scenario characterized by a deeper recession and a weaker recovery, a sizable weak tail of banks could see their capital buffers depleted to the levels that could constrain their lending capacity (figure 9). these weak banks’ capital shortfall relative to broad regulatory requirements—which include the counter-cyclical capital buffer, capital conservation buffer, and systemic buffers—could reach $220 billion, even after accounting for borrower- and bank-oriented mitigation policies (see chapter 4).nonbank financial institutions (nbfis) have entered the crisis with elevated vulnerabilities (figure 10). they have managed to cope with the pandemic-induced market turmoil thanks to policy support, but fragilities remain high. asset managers, for example, could be forced into fire sales if portfolio losses are larger and redemptions last longer than during the march sell-off. nbfis play a growing role in credit markets, including riskier segments, and the increased links between nbfis and banks imply that fragilities could spread through the financial system.icr < 1 in 2019:q4icr < 1 in 2020:q2 and an increase in net debt between q4 and q2icr < 1 in 2020:q2figure 7. publicly listed firms: debt at risk(percent of

october 2020 xvsovereign vulnerabilities have increased because countries have expanded fiscal support, and sovereigns may face a sharp rise in contingent liabilities. vulner-abilities have increased across multiple sectors, with 6 out of 29 jurisdictions with systemically important financial sectors now showing elevated vulnerabili-ties in the corporate, banking, and sovereign sectors (figure 11).because of the pandemic, the financing needs of emerging markets have risen sharply. concerns about new debt supply and weak domestic fundamentals may have curtailed demand for local currency bonds from foreign investors (figure 12), especially where they hold large shares of debt and where the domestic inves-tor base may not be sufficiently deep. some emerging market central banks purchased a substantial share of bonds in the secondary market to stabilize market conditions (see chapter\\\\xa02). frontier market economies face even greater financing challenges, as the covid-19 shock pushed borrowing costs for many to prohibi-tive levels—calling for official support. as policymakers build a bridge to recovery, poli-cies will have to adjust, depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of the economic rebound (see policy road map in the at-a-glance box at the beginning of this ). at each step, policymakers should be mindful of intertemporal trade-offs and of unintended consequences—the ben-efits of using available buffers today should be carefully balanced against the possible need for further support in the future, as well as the risk of exacerbating future vulnerabilities.as economies reopen, continued monetary policy accommodation and targeted liquidity support will be essential for sustaining the recovery. a robust framework for debt restructuring will be critical for reducing debt overhangs and resolving nonviable firms. low-income countries with financing difficul-ties may require multilateral support. despite its adverse effect on firms’ environmental performance, the covid-19 crisis also presents an opportunity to engineer a transition to a greener economy (see chapter 5). after the pandemic is fully under control, policy support can be gradually withdrawn and policy priori-ties should focus on rebuilding bank buffers, strength-ening regulation of nonbank financial institutions and stepping up prudential supervision to contain excessive risk taking in a lower-for-longer interest-rate environment.other domesticnonresidentsdomestic bankscentral banktotal change in lcdebt outstandingfigure 12. change in local currency

taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-etary policy accommodation and stronger corporate

share of firms with low cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with fewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including in emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions (figure es.3). this rebound is especially evident among small and medium firms. likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue to face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in housing activity and a further decline in home prices. global real house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major central banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. in advanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller decline of about 2.4 percent. countries with a large share of floating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic average recorded double-digit declines in home prices.given the size and concentration of commercial real estate (cre) and its strong connections with the broader financial system and the real economy, stress in that sector can have significant financial stability implications. as a share of gdp , cre-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of gdp in europe and 18 percent in the united states. concerns about the risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding sources become less available for cre borrowers needing to refi-nance—banks have

property sector downturn, and growing strains on local gov-ernment financing weigh heavily on market sentiment. the renminbi has faced notable downward pressure as equity prices have fallen sharply. disinflationary pressures have grown, prompting the people’s bank of china to cut policy rates—one of the few central banks to ease monetary policy. however, such easing and other announced stimulus measures have not yet restored confidence among businesses, consumers, and, impor-tantly, homebuyers. stronger private property developers and even state-owned developers have experienced materially

fund | october 2023 xisoft landing or abrupt awakening?with core inflation still high and declining only slowly in many advanced economies, central banks may need to keep monetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in markets. in emerging market economies, progress on lowering inflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early rate hikes becoming apparent. however, there are discrepancies across regions. widening divergence of inflation and economic outlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of the global monetary policy. yet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, whereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is avoided, has fueled asset valuation since the april 2023 global financial stability report. despite the declines in equity prices since september, driven by rising long-term real rates, finan-cial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net (figure es.1). taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued mon-etary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. emerging markets such as chile, hungary, india, mexico, and poland have also seen notable equity price increases, consis-tent with the appreciation of most major emerging market currencies in the first half of the year. upside surprises to the inflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, resulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. while acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, a weak tail of banks remains in some countries. in addition, cracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could turn into worrisome fault lines. in the event of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of the global finan-cial system. most notably, the global credit cycle has started to turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and credit growth slows. the imf’s growth-at-risk measure summa-rizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in april 2023 (figure es.2). in a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing does not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and financial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the growth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more firmly skewed to the downside.united stateseuro areaother advanced economieschinaemerging markets excluding

accumulated during the pan-demic to shore up their balance sheets and interest payments. however, these factors may not be sufficient to stave off a trend of rising repayment difficulties. indeed, the share of firms with low cash-to-interest-expense ratios—that is, weaker firms with fewer buffers—has rebounded over the past two years, including in emerging markets, as firms face tighter funding conditions (figure es.3). this rebound is especially evident among small and medium firms. likewise, mortgage borrowers will continue to face a higher repayment burden, leading to a slowdown in housing activity and a further decline in home prices. global real house prices have been falling since late 2022, as major central banks have aggressively tightened monetary policy. in advanced economies, real house prices fell 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023, whereas emerging markets saw a smaller decline of about 2.4 percent. countries with a large share of floating-rate mortgages and house prices above the prepandemic average recorded double-digit declines in home prices.given the size and concentration of commercial real estate (cre) and its strong connections with the broader financial system and the real economy, stress in that sector can have significant financial stability implications. as a share of gdp , cre-related debt equates to nearly 12 percent of gdp in europe and 18 percent in the united states. concerns about the risk of a widening funding gap have emerged, as funding sources become less available for cre borrowers needing to refi-nance—banks have

investment funds with shorter funding structures, especially those providing daily liquidity, could face redemption pressure from their investors, as higher interest rates reduce the value of their fixed-income assets. those using leveraged investment strategies predicated on swift disinflation may be forced to unwind positions should inflation stay doggedly high.chapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies (emdes) are estimated to reach about $2 trillion per year. the private sector is key to financing the required investments in emdes, given limited fis-cal space and challenging market conditions. by 2030, the share of private finance must increase to about 80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in emdes, and the proportion should be even greater in emdes outside of china (figure es.8). policy recommendationsultimately, sustainable economic growth requires both price and financial stability. central banks must remain determined in their fight against inflation until there is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably toward targets, although the stance of monetary policy should reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy frame-work, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combi-nations depend on the nature of the shock and country-specific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehen-sive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mis-matches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate mini-mum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in residential real estate prices on household balance sheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions. con-tinued vigilance is warranted to monitor vulnerabilities international monetary fund | october 2023 xisoft landing or abrupt

investment funds with shorter funding structures, especially those providing daily liquidity, could face redemption pressure from their investors, as higher interest rates reduce the value of their fixed-income assets. those using leveraged investment strategies predicated on swift disinflation may be forced to unwind positions should inflation stay doggedly high.chapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies (emdes) are estimated to reach about $2 trillion per year. the private sector is key to financing the required investments in emdes, given limited fis-cal space and challenging market conditions. by 2030, the share of private finance must increase to about 80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in emdes, and the proportion should be even greater in emdes outside of china (figure es.8). policy recommendationsultimately, sustainable economic growth requires both price and financial stability. central banks must remain determined in their fight against inflation until there is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably toward targets, although the stance of monetary policy should reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy frame-work, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combi-nations depend on the nature of the shock and country-specific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehen-sive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mis-matches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate mini-mum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in residential real estate prices on household balance sheets and, ultimately, on financial institutions. con-tinued vigilance is warranted to monitor vulnerabilities international monetary fund | october 2023 xvin the cre sector, including reviews of banks’ cre valuations, and ensure that provisions are adequate. buffers should be built to help guard against future losses and to support the continued provision of credit during stress times. for example, authorities may raise countercyclical capital buffers or sectoral systemic risk buffers if circumstances allow. to avoid procyclical effects, the raising of buffers should be conditioned on the absence of signs that credit is already being constrained by the adequacy of banks’ capital.a broad mix of structural and financial policies is needed to create an attractive investment environment for private capital to support climate finance needs in emdes. a stronger climate information architecture—data, disclosures, and alignment approaches (including taxonomies)—is necessary to attract private investors. financial sector policies should be focused on creating climate impact. t ransition taxonomies in emdes can help institutions identify activities that may reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time, including in the most carbon-intensive sectors. disclosures and labels for sustainable investment funds should enhance market transparency, market integrity, and alignment with climate impact–oriented outcomes. through its convening power, the imf has a crucial role to play in mobilizing private climate finance, particularly in lower-income countries. the resilience and sustain-ability facility can be a catalyst for private finance through its policy conditionality, supporting reforms that can help attract private capital.']\",\n",

pro-tectionist policies could reignite capital outflows and hurt growth prospects, testing the resilience of these economies. countries with strong international financial and trade links in particular could be challenged by tighter global financial conditions or adverse trade measures. these risks could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in the corporate sector and could increase the debt at risk of the weakest firms by $130–$230 billion. a sharp turn away from the current supportive external environment could reinforce risks in countries whose weakest banks are challenged to maintain asset quality and adequately provision for bad loans after long credit booms. china faces mounting risks to financial stability as credit continues to rise rapidly. china’s bank assets are now more than triple its gdp , and other nonbank financial institutions also have heightened credit expo-sure. many financial institutions continue to be overly dependent on wholesale financing, with sizable asset-liability mismatches and elevated liquidity and credit risks. recent turbulence in money markets illustrates the vulnerabilities that remain in china’s increasingly large, opaque, and interconnected system. european banking systems must address structural challengesconsiderable progress has been made in the european banking sector over the past few years, and optimism about a cyclical upturn in advanced econo-mies has helped boost european banks’ equity prices. however, as assessed in the october 2016 gfsr, a cyclical recovery will likely be insufficient on its own to restore the profitability of persistently weak banks. although many banks face profitability challenges, this is particularly true for domestic banks, which are most exposed to their home economies: almost three-quar-ters of these banks had weak returns in 2016 (defined as return on equity of less than 8 percent). this report examines the system-wide structural features that are compounding profitability challenges. one structural challenge is overbanking, which varies by nature and degree from country to country. some examples include banking systems with assets that are large rela-tive to the economy, with a long weak tail of banks, or with too many banks with a regional focus or a narrow mandate. these features can result in limited lending opportunities or a high number of branches relative to the assets in the banking system, adding to costs and reducing operational efficiencies. although measures are being taken to address profitability concerns, more progress needs to be made in reducing overbanking in the countries with the biggest challenges. system-wide headwinds are a problem not only within countries but can also affect the profitability of large, systemically important banks in europe. these institutions find it difficult to keep up with their global competitors, and in some cases this may be partly due to profitability problems in their home countries. until these structural impediments are addressed, a simple restructuring of their business models is unlikely to yield sufficient profitability. left unresolved, a combi-nation of weak profits, lack of access to private capital, and large bad debt burdens impedes recovery and could reignite systemic risks. it is crucial to get the policy mix right securing and building on improvements in stabil-ity and market expectations will require concerted and careful efforts by policymakers at the national and global levels. policymakers should adjust the policy mix to deliver a stronger path for long-term and inclu-sive growth while avoiding politically expedient but ultimately counterproductive inward-looking policies. in the united states, policymakers should vigilantly monitor increased leverage and deteriorating credit quality. regulators should preemptively address exces-sive financial risk taking. prudential and supervisory actions should be taken if policy stimulus leads to an increase in debt-financed investment and rising corpo-rate vulnerabilities. tax reforms that reduce incentives for debt financing could help attenuate risks of a fur-ther buildup in leverage, and possibly even encourage firms to lower existing tax-advantaged leverage.in europe, further actions should be taken to address bank profitability and legacy challenges. banks have the

frameworks. to determine weak links in banking systems with significant asset quality challenges, consideration could be given to targeted asset quality reviews for banks that have not undergone such an exercise. regulators should then take action to resolve unviable institutions to remove excess capacity. authorities should also focus on removing system-wide impediments to profitability, including addressing nonperforming loans and developing frameworks that accelerate recovery.emerging market economies should address domestic vulnerabilities to enhance their resilience to external shocks. they should seek to preserve financial stability by taking further steps to strengthen supervi-sion and bank governance while maintaining a robust macroprudential toolkit. bank regulators should closely monitor vulnerabilities in countries with wide net foreign-currency positions or foreign-currency matu-rity gaps. policymakers should focus on strengthening the health of corporates and the banking system by proactively monitoring and reducing vulnerabilities and improving restructuring mechanisms. in china, although the authorities have recognized the urgent need to deleverage the financial system and have undertaken substantive corrective measures, supervi-sory attention should concentrate on banks’ emerg-ing risks, especially fast asset growth among smaller banks, increasing reliance on wholesale funding, and risks from interconnections between shadow products and interbank markets. but staving off further bouts of market instability—and ultimately, macro instabil-ity—will require measures to address the policy tension between maintaining a high level of growth and the need for deleveraging. the postcrisis reform agenda has strengthened over-sight of the financial system, raised capital and liquid-ity buffers of individual institutions, and improved cooperation among regulators. caution is needed when considering any future regulatory rollback. while regu-lation is never costless, neither is its removal; weaken-ing regulatory standards comes at the cost of higher financial stability risks. decisions to opt out of mutu-ally established regulations in an uncoordinated or uni-lateral manner could result in financial fragmentation and could threaten to reignite a race to the bottom in regulatory standards. completing the regulatory reform agenda is vital to ensure that weaknesses are addressed and to reduce uncertainty. although there is scope to consider the impact and unintended consequences of reforms, such a review should not unravel the broad improvements achieved in buttressing the resilience of the global financial system.this report also includes two thematic chapters analyzing the long-term implications of low growth and low interest rates for financial intermediation, and the ability of country authorities to influence domestic financial conditions in a financially integrated world.a long period of low growth and low interest rates would challenge financial intermediation advanced economies have experienced a pro-longed episode of low interest rates and low growth since the global financial crisis. from a longer-term perspective, real interest rates have been on a steady decline over the past three decades. despite recent signs of an increase in longer-term yields, particularly in the united states, japan’s experience suggests that an imminent and permanent exit from low rates is not necessarily guaranteed, especially in view of the prevalence of slow-moving structural factors, such as demographic aging in many advanced economies. chapter 2 analyzes the potential long-term impact of a scenario of sustained low growth and low real and nominal rates for the business models of banks, insur-ers, and pension funds and for the products offered by the financial sector. it finds that yield curves would likely flatten, lowering bank earnings—particularly of smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified institu-tions—and presenting long-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pension funds. if bank deposit rates cannot drop (significantly) below zero, bank profits would be squeezed even further. smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified banks would be hurt most. as banks reach for yield, new financial stability challenges would arise in their home and host markets.more generally, a “low-for-long” interest rate envi-ronment, driven by population aging, rising longevity, and stagnation in productivity, could fundamentally change the nature of financial intermediation. for example, credit demand would likely be lower in this scenario, whereas household demand for transaction services would likely rise. consequently, bank busi-ness models in advanced economies may evolve toward fees-based and utility banking services. demographic international monetary fund | april 2017 ixfinancial stability has improvedfinancial stability has continued to improve

challenges. banks have the primary responsibility for developing sustain-able earnings by tackling business model problems through consolidation, branch rationalization, and investment in technology to increase medium-term efficiency. encouragingly, supervisors are increasingly executive su mm ary international monetary fund | april 2017 xiemphasizing the examination of bank business models in their supervisory frameworks. to determine weak links in banking systems with significant asset quality challenges, consideration could be given to targeted asset quality reviews for banks that have not undergone such an exercise. regulators should then take action to resolve unviable institutions to remove excess capacity. authorities should also focus on removing system-wide impediments to profitability, including addressing nonperforming loans and developing frameworks that accelerate recovery.emerging market economies should address domestic vulnerabilities to enhance their resilience to external shocks. they should seek to preserve financial stability by taking further steps to strengthen supervi-sion and bank governance while maintaining a robust macroprudential toolkit. bank regulators should closely monitor vulnerabilities in countries with wide net foreign-currency positions or foreign-currency matu-rity gaps. policymakers should focus on strengthening the health of corporates and the banking system by proactively monitoring and reducing vulnerabilities and improving restructuring mechanisms. in china, although the authorities have recognized the urgent need to deleverage the financial system and have undertaken substantive corrective measures, supervi-sory attention should concentrate on banks’ emerg-ing risks, especially fast asset growth among smaller banks, increasing reliance on wholesale funding, and risks from interconnections between shadow products and interbank markets. but staving off further bouts of market instability—and ultimately, macro instabil-ity—will require measures to address the policy tension between maintaining a high level of growth and the need for deleveraging. the postcrisis reform agenda has strengthened over-sight of the financial system, raised capital and liquid-ity buffers of individual institutions, and improved cooperation among regulators. caution is needed when considering any future regulatory rollback. while regu-lation is never costless, neither is its removal; weaken-ing regulatory standards comes at the cost of higher financial stability risks. decisions to opt out of mutu-ally established regulations in an uncoordinated or uni-lateral manner could result in financial fragmentation and could threaten to reignite a race to the bottom in regulatory standards. completing the regulatory reform agenda is vital to ensure that weaknesses are addressed and to reduce uncertainty. although there is scope to consider the impact and unintended consequences of reforms, such a review should not unravel the broad improvements achieved in buttressing the resilience of the global financial system.this report also includes two thematic chapters analyzing the long-term implications of low growth and low interest rates for financial intermediation, and the ability of country authorities to influence domestic financial conditions in a financially integrated world.a long period of low growth and low interest rates would challenge financial intermediation advanced economies have experienced a pro-longed episode of low interest rates and low growth since the global financial crisis. from a longer-term perspective, real interest rates have been on a steady decline over the past three decades. despite recent signs of an increase in longer-term yields, particularly in the united states, japan’s experience suggests that an imminent and permanent exit from low rates is not necessarily guaranteed, especially in view of the prevalence of slow-moving structural factors, such as demographic aging in many advanced economies. chapter 2 analyzes the potential long-term impact of a scenario of sustained low growth and low real and nominal rates for the business models of banks, insur-ers, and pension funds and for the products offered by the financial sector. it finds that yield curves would likely flatten, lowering bank earnings—particularly of smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified institu-tions—and presenting long-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pension funds. if bank deposit rates cannot drop (significantly) below zero, bank profits would be squeezed even further. smaller, deposit-funded, and less diversified banks would be hurt most. as banks reach for yield, new financial stability challenges would arise in their home and host markets.more generally, a “low-for-long” interest rate envi-ronment, driven by population aging, rising longevity, and stagnation in productivity, could fundamentally change the nature of financial intermediation. for example, credit demand would likely be lower in this scenario, whereas household demand for transaction services would likely rise. consequently, bank busi-ness models in advanced economies may evolve toward fees-based and utility banking services. demographic xii international monetary fund | april 2017global financial stability report: getting the policy mix rightchanges would also increase demand for health and long-term-care insurance, and low asset returns would accelerate the transition to defined-contribution private pension plans. demand would weaken for guaranteed-return, long-term savings products offered by insurers, and it would strengthen for passive index funds offered by asset managers. policies could help ease the adjust-ment to such an environment. in general, prudential frameworks would need to provide incentives to ensure longer-term stability instead of falling prey to demands for deregulation to ease short-term pain.policymakers challenged to effectively steer domestic financial conditions amid increased international financial integrationchapter 3 shows that countries can retain influence over their domestic financial conditions in a globally integrated financial system. although greater financial integration can complicate the management of domes-tic financial conditions, it need not result in a loss of control. the chapter develops financial conditions indices that make it possible to compare a large set of advanced and emerging market economies. it finds that global financial conditions account for 20 to 40 percent of the variation in countries’ domestic financial condi-tions, with notable differences among economies. the importance of this global factor does not, however, seem to have increased much over the past two decades. despite the significant role of global financial shocks, countries seem to be able to influence their own financial conditions to achieve domestic objec-tives—specifically, through monetary policy. but because domestic financial conditions react strongly and rapidly to global financial shocks, countries may find it difficult to implement timely policy responses. emerging market economies, which are more sensi-tive to global financial conditions, should prepare for tighter external financial conditions. governments can promote domestic financial deepening to enhance resil-ience to global financial shocks. in particular, develop-ing a local investor base, as well as fostering greater equity- and bond-market depth and liquidity, can help dampen the impact of such shocks.

new vulnerabilities have emerged, and the resilience of the global financial system has yet to be tested. since the last global financial stability report (gfsr), near-term risks to global financial stability have increased somewhat, but financial conditions are still broadly accommodative and supportive of growth in the near term. that said, risks could rise sharply should pressures in emerging market economies mount or if trade tensions escalate. meanwhile, medium-term risks remain elevated, as easy financial conditions contribute to a further buildup of financial vulnerabilities.over the past six months, global financial conditions have marginally tightened and the divergence between advanced and emerging market economies has grown. the global economic expansion continues, providing an opportunity to strengthen balance sheets and rebuild buffers, but growth appears to have peaked in some major economies, as discussed in the october 2018 world economic outlook (weo). yet financial condi-tions in advanced economies remain accommodative, particularly in the united states, with interest rates still low by historical standards, risk appetite robust, and asset valuations rising in major markets. financial con-ditions have remained broadly stable in china, where authorities have eased monetary policy to offset external pressures and the impact of tighter financial regulations. in contrast, financial conditions in most emerging mar-ket economies have tightened since mid-april, driven by higher external financing costs, rising idiosyncratic risks, and escalating trade tensions. as noted in the april gfsr, notwithstanding improved fundamentals over recent years, emerging market economies remain vulnerable to spillovers from monetary policy normalization in advanced economies and could face reduced capital inflows even under a relatively benign baseline scenario. since then, with rising u.s. interest rates and a stronger dollar, as well as the intensification of trade tensions, a number of emerging market economies have experienced a reversal in portfolio flows. but with buoyant global risk appetite, market pressures have to date been concentrated in countries with large external imbal-ances and weak policy frameworks. however, the imf’s capital-flows-at-risk analysis suggests that with a 5 percent probability, emerging market economies (excluding china) could face debt portfolio outflows in the medium term of $100 billion or more over a period of four quarters (or 0.6 percent of their combined gdp), broadly similar in magnitude to the global financial crisis. near-term risks to global financial stability—assessed using the growth-at-risk (gar) approach—have increased somewhat over the past six months. however, a much sharper tightening of financial conditions in advanced economies would signifi-cantly increase short-term risks. an intensification of concerns about the resilience and policy credibility in emerging markets may lead to further capital outflows and possibly rising global risk aversion. a broader escalation of trade actions may undermine investor confidence, harming the economic expansion. politi-cal and policy uncertainty (for example, in the event of a no-deal brexit or the reemergence of concerns about fiscal policy in some highly indebted euro area countries) could adversely affect market sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. finally, with infla-tion firming up, central banks may step up the pace of monetary policy normalization, which could lead to a sudden tightening of global financial conditions. overall, market participants appear complacent about the risk of a sharp tightening of financial conditions.medium-term risks to global financial stability and growth remain elevated. a

fund | october 2018global financial stability report—a decade after the global financial crisis: are we safer?percent of their combined gdp). banks have increased their capital and liquidity buffers since the crisis, but they remain exposed to highly indebted companies, households, and sovereigns; to their holdings of opaque and illiquid assets; or to their use of foreign currency funding. external borrowing has continued to rise in most emerging market economies. this poses challenges for countries that are facing external financing risks and trade shocks, but that lack adequate reserve buffers or strong domestic investor bases to cushion the impact of external shocks. given the challenging external environ-ment, policymakers in emerging market economies should be prepared for further capital outflow pressures. in addition to the analysis of the key risks to global financial stability, this report takes stock of the global regulatory reform agenda over the past decade and looks at whether the global financial ecosystem since the crisis has evolved in the intended direction: that is, toward greater safety.on the positive side, the broad regulatory agenda set by the international community has helped strengthen the global banking system. some of the pernicious forms of shadow banking that developed in the run-up to the crisis have been curtailed, and most countries now have a macroprudential authority and some tools with which to oversee and contain risks to the financial system. however, a number of factors may have led to some fragmentation in funding and market liquidity. regulators are increasingly focusing on the liquidity of individual entities within international banking groups. there are benefits to greater ring-fencing of liquid-ity, particularly in the context of resolution during stress periods, but there is a risk that doing so could fragment liquidity in international banking groups. in capital markets, market liquidity appears to have become more segmented, for example, across different trading platforms. while there is no clear evidence of a broad-based deterioration in market liquidity, careful monitoring of liquidity conditions is warranted.to further improve the resilience of the global financial system, the financial regulatory reform agenda should be completed, and a rollback of reforms should be avoided. to adequately address potential systemic risks, financial regulation and supervision should be used more proactively. broad-based macroprudential tools, including countercyclical capital buffers, should be used more actively in coun-tries where financial conditions remain accommoda-tive and where vulnerabilities are high. furthermore, financial stability requires new macroprudential tools for addressing vulnerabilities outside the banking sector. finally, regulators and supervisors must remain attentive to new risks, including possible threats to financial stability stemming from cybersecurity, finan-cial technology, and other institutions or activities outside the perimeter of prudential regulation.']\",\n",

corrections incredit derivative and cdo markets, regulatorsmust ensure that financial institutions main-tain robust counterparty risk managementpractices, not least to contain the spillovereffect of market corrections should theyoccur. directors also stressed the importanceof disclosure and transparency to enhancethe flow of information, of the standards andcodes work to help improve regulatoryframeworks, and of improving basic financialeducation especially among individualinvestors. in the context of rising householdindebtedness, mainly in the mortgage market,directors welcomed the warnings that regula-tors in some major countries have given totheir lending institutions to tighten creditstandards. for the medium term, the risk ofgrowing global imbalances has to be addressedby a cooperative effort by the major coun-tries, with each adopting policies appropriateto its circumstances.aspects of global asset allocationdirectors welcomed the work undertakenby staff on global asset allocation and theincreasing role of institutional investors infinancial markets. they noted that a betterunderstanding of the investment patterns ofpension funds, insurance companies, mutualfunds, and, increasingly, hedge funds wouldhelp anticipate the potential for abruptchanges in capital flows across borders andasset classes, with direct relevance to financialstability and to policymakers.directors considered the diversity of proce-dures followed by various institutionalinvestors when allocating assets, reflectingtheir different time horizons, liability struc-tures, and “cultural backgrounds,” as well asexternal influences, such as accounting andfinancial reporting standards, tax rules, ratingagencies, and the availability of financialinstruments needed for adequate risk manage-ment. in this context, most directors agreedthat the increasing dominance of strategicasset allocations driven more by long-termeconomic fundamentals, including risk man-agement objectives, was a positive develop-ment, as it helps reduce the volatility and“noise” in financial markets, and makes someasset classes, such as emerging market debt,less prone to boom and bust cycles. in particu-lar, the continued growth of institutions withlong-term liabilities, such as pension funds,brings benefits from the point of view offinancial stability. some directors, however,noted that shifts in asset allocations by suchinstitutions might unsettle emerging marketswith relatively shallow financial markets, oramplify long swings and hinder market pricediscovery.directors noted the sustained decline in“home bias” on the part of institutionalinvestors throughout mature economies overthe past 15 years, particularly with regard toequity holdings. directors agreed that majorfactors cited in the shift toward more interna-tionalized portfolios included less strict invest-ment restrictions, reduced information costs,and the spread of modern portfolio manage-ment practices. by raising average returnswhile reducing portfolio volatility, these devel-opments have bolstered financial stability.however, directors noted that the decline inhome bias has also increased cross-border cap-ital flows and has probably led to greatercross-border correlations among asset mar-kets. accordingly, directors underscored thatfund surveillance has taken on even greaterimportance in a world in which institutionalportfolios have become increasingly interna-tional. a few directors expressed doubt aboutthe report’s findings that investors from majoreconomies, like the united states and theunited kingdom, would have little to gainfrom further international diversification ofportfolios.directors discussed the implications forfinancial

the imf a major contributor tointernational regulatory debates. at the sametime, many directors saw scope for improvingthe gfsr by making it more concise, sharplyfocused, and policy-oriented. they also calledfor reduced overlap between the gfsr andthe weo where possible, and for the fund’soperational work to better integrate thegfsr’s findings.global financial market surveillancedirectors welcomed the continuedimprovement in global financial stability. thecurrent configuration of solid growth, lowinflation, low bond yields, flat yield curves,and tight credit spreads has supported inter-national financial markets, helping tostrengthen the resilience of the global finan-cial system. furthermore, the much improvedbalance sheets of the sovereign, corporate,and household sectors, together with struc-tural changes such as the growing importanceand diversity of institutional investors andtheir behaviors, have provided an importantcushion to financial markets. however,directors agreed that while the benign con-figuration just mentioned has reduced risk inthe near term, it has stored up potential vul-nerabilities for the medium term, mainly inthe form of larger global imbalances andhigher debt levels, particularly by the house-hold sector.directors agreed that the search for yieldremains a dominant theme in financial mar-kets, leading to further narrowing of creditspreads and a greater investor focus onemploying leverage and alternative invest-ments to enhance returns. the search for yieldcontinues to stem from low long-term interestrates in mature markets, which have beencaused by a variety of reasons. these includethe low level of investment that has resulted inan excess supply of global saving, a reductionin inflation risk premia due to greater centralbank credibility, reserve accumulation by asiancentral banks, and an ongoing shift in institu-tional investor portfolio preferences fromequities to bonds. in part reflecting this lastfactor, equity earnings yields remain relativelyhigh compared to risk-free government bondyields. the search for yield has also been stim-ulated by continued subdued volatility acrossmost financial markets.directors noted the impact of the search foryield in credit and mortgage markets. giventhe compression of spreads in credit markets,investors have increasingly turned to usingleverage in various ways to enhance returns,including through a proliferation of struc-tured credit products. they noted that themarket quickly stabilized following distur-bances in the credit derivatives market inapril and may related to developments in the148annex summing up by the chairman148the following remarks by the chairman were made at the conclusion of the executiveboard’s discussion of the global financial stability report on august 29, 2005 .u.s. auto sector, and the corporate credit mar-ket functioned surprisingly smoothly inabsorbing downgrades in this sector. directorsobserved that this likely reflected the relativelyisolated nature of the difficulties as the corpo-rate sector remains broadly healthy, withstrong balance sheets and low default rates.however, they considered that the corporatecredit cycle appears to be peaking as corpora-tions have begun to increase balance sheetleverage in a variety of ways. this has increasedthe risk of specific corporate credit eventscausing corrections in credit derivative andcollateralized debt obligation (cdo) marketsin the period ahead.directors noted that the dollar reboundedagainst major international currencies despitethe widening u.s. current account deficit, asinvestors focused on interest rate and growthdifferentials in favor of the united states. inthis connection, the global appetite for u.s.assets has to date remained strong. however,the risk of increased exchange rate volatilityand a related spike in u.s. bond yields due toa reduction in capital flow to the unitedstates––while being a low probability eventgiven the current economic and financial out-look––cannot be dismissed, and would carrylarge costs to economic growth and financialmarkets. directors welcomed the initial movesby the chinese and malaysian authorities tomake their currencies more flexible.many directors expressed concern that lowmortgage financing costs have induced sub-stantial increases in household debt, particu-larly in the united states. relaxation in creditstandards and products such as interest-onlyand negative amortization mortgages may beadding to risks in mortgage markets, allowinghouseholds to take on larger levels of debtand giving increased access to marginal bor-rowers. however, household net worth hasalso risen due to increases in asset prices, par-ticularly in the housing sector, though mar-ginal borrowers remain particularly vulnerableto possible rises in interest rates and/ordeclines in housing prices.directors welcomed the evidence thatemerging financial markets have becomeincreasingly resilient to market disturbances,while cautioning that the positive global eco-nomic environment may to some extent bemasking underlying vulnerabilities in somecountries. indeed, in recent months, politicalrisks and market volatility have increased in anumber of emerging market countries thatbear watching. nonetheless, it is encouragingthat many emerging market countries havecontinued to build cushions against possibleadverse developments, including by accumu-lating reserves, undertaking early financing ofexternal needs, and improving debt struc-tures. directors took note of the ongoingbroadening of the investor base for emergingmarkets and the extension of investor interestinto local instruments. while the increasedinterest in local markets has to some extentbeen fostered by cyclical developments, thereare also signs that local-currency bonds in par-ticular are becoming an interesting asset classfor foreign investors. this should, in turn,help deepen local markets and reduce emerg-ing market vulnerabilities to currency risk.overall, directors considered that these devel-opments have kept emerging bond marketsresilient in the face of mature credit marketdisturbances and specific country problems.directors also welcomed recent improve-ments in the balance sheets of key sectors inmature market economies. moreover, indica-tors of market and credit risk and financialstrength underscore the resilience of thebanking and insurance sectors in both matureand emerging markets. a number ofdirectors, however, stressed the need to guardagainst the potentially destabilizing effect ofhedge fund operations and of the growing useof structured products, while preserving thebenefits of these innovations in terms of mar-ket efficiency and liquidity.while considering policy measures to miti-gate risks, directors stressed that ongoing riskmanagement by individual financial institu-tions and supervisory scrutiny by regulatorssumming up by the chairman149are the most important lines of defense. inparticular, given the risk of corrections incredit derivative and cdo markets, regulatorsmust ensure that financial institutions main-tain robust counterparty risk managementpractices, not least to contain the spillovereffect of market corrections should theyoccur. directors also stressed the importanceof disclosure and transparency to enhancethe flow of information, of the standards andcodes work to help improve regulatoryframeworks, and of improving basic financialeducation especially among individualinvestors. in the context of rising householdindebtedness, mainly in the mortgage market,directors welcomed the warnings that regula-tors in some major countries have given totheir lending institutions to tighten creditstandards. for the medium term, the risk ofgrowing global imbalances has to be addressedby a cooperative effort by the major coun-tries, with each adopting policies appropriateto its circumstances.aspects of global asset allocationdirectors welcomed the work undertakenby staff on global asset allocation and theincreasing role of institutional investors infinancial markets. they noted that a betterunderstanding of the investment patterns ofpension funds, insurance companies, mutualfunds, and, increasingly, hedge funds wouldhelp anticipate the potential for abruptchanges in capital flows across borders andasset classes, with direct relevance to financialstability and to policymakers.directors considered the diversity of proce-dures followed by various institutionalinvestors when allocating assets, reflectingtheir different time horizons, liability struc-tures, and “cultural backgrounds,” as well asexternal influences, such as accounting andfinancial reporting standards, tax rules, ratingagencies, and the availability of financialinstruments needed for adequate risk manage-ment. in this context, most directors agreedthat the increasing dominance of strategicasset allocations driven more by long-termeconomic fundamentals, including risk man-agement objectives, was a positive develop-ment, as it helps reduce the volatility and“noise” in financial markets, and makes someasset classes, such as emerging market debt,less prone to boom and bust cycles. in particu-lar, the continued growth of institutions withlong-term liabilities, such as pension funds,brings benefits from the point of view offinancial stability. some directors, however,noted that shifts in asset allocations by suchinstitutions might unsettle emerging marketswith relatively shallow financial markets, oramplify long swings and hinder market pricediscovery.directors noted the sustained decline in“home bias” on the part of institutionalinvestors throughout mature economies overthe past 15 years, particularly with regard toequity holdings. directors agreed that majorfactors cited in the shift toward more interna-tionalized portfolios included less strict invest-ment restrictions, reduced information costs,and the spread of modern portfolio manage-ment practices. by raising average returnswhile reducing portfolio volatility, these devel-opments have bolstered financial stability.however, directors noted that the decline inhome bias has also increased cross-border cap-ital flows and has probably led to greatercross-border correlations among asset mar-kets. accordingly, directors underscored thatfund surveillance has taken on even greaterimportance in a world in which institutionalportfolios have become increasingly interna-tional. a few directors expressed doubt aboutthe report’s findings that investors from majoreconomies, like the united states and theunited kingdom, would have little to gainfrom further international diversification ofportfolios.directors discussed the implications forfinancial stability of proposals and potentialchanges in accounting policy. they recog-nized the importance of international effortsannex summing up by the chairman150summing up by the chairman151to improve accounting principles in order toenhance the comparability and transparencyof accounts and to strengthen market disci-pline. however, views differed on the impactof changes in accounting principles on finan-cial market stability. a number of directorsagreed that accounting and financial report-ing standards may influence market behaviorand asset allocations by key institutionalinvestors, including by potentially encourag-ing long-term investors to adopt short-termtime horizons, or by reducing the diversity ofmarket behaviors across institutional investorcategories, particularly as it relates to theirlong-term, stable investment behavior. thesedirectors encouraged ongoing internationalefforts to preserve both the measurement ben-efits of using market or fair values, whereverpossible, and secular gains in financial stabil-ity. a number of other directors suggestedthat, while some issues exist as to fair valua-tion of assets and liabilities with thin markets,fair value accounting would strengthen trans-parency in financial markets, and would notlead to a shift to short-run strategies by majorinstitutional investors.corporate bond markets in emergingmarket countriesdirectors welcomed the detailed study oncorporate bond markets in emerging marketcountries. they observed that the achievementof macroeconomic stability by a number ofemerging market countries suggests that thetime may be right to press ahead with meas-ures that contribute to the development ofcorporate bond markets. directors called forcontinued efforts by emerging markets to facil-itate the growth of institutional investors, andnoted that medium- and small-sized corpora-tions should adopt high standards of trans-parency and corporate governance to facilitatemarket access. directors stressed that for theeffective functioning of securities markets, theauthorities should adopt a regulatory frame-work that ensures investor protection and mar-ket integrity and contains systemic risks.directors noted that emerging marketcountries should take measures that reducethe approval time and cost of issuance, includ-ing costs associated with discriminatory taxa-tion. directors stressed the importance of awell-developed secondary market in improv-ing price discovery and liquidity while at thesame time acknowledging that only a fewindustrial countries were able to achieve thisgoal. directors also noted the complementaryrole of the development of a governmentbond market, and that regional cooperationmay help promote the development of bondmarkets for countries that lack the minimumefficient scale needed for a deep and liquidbond market.directors stressed the role of corporatebond markets as an alternative funding sourcefor corporations, noting that such marketscould act as a buffer in the face of suddeninterruptions in bank credit or internationalcapital flows. however, several directors cau-tioned against too rapid a growth of corporatebond markets in countries that lack the sup-porting financial infrastructure. in particular,the rapid growth in assets under managementof institutional investors combined with exces-sive concentration in a few market partici-pants could fuel asset price bubbles and causefinancial market instability. directors encour-aged countries to take measures to preventexcessive concentration as well as to improverisk management practices and underscoredthe need for a balanced development of therequired institutions, intermediaries, and mar-ket microstructure to reduce risks.directors offered several suggestions to takethe gfsr to the next level of developmentafter three years of publication, which staffwill consider carefully going forward.']\",\n",

inthe credit quality of emerging market borrow-ers. most emerging market sovereign borrow-ers have used this period well, undertakingsubstantial prefinancing of their externalfinancing needs, conducting debt manage-ment operations to improve the resilience oftheir balance sheets, and, in a couple ofinstances, issuing local currency bonds inglobal markets. directors also welcomedbroad-based improvements in the financialhealth of the domestic banking sector inemerging market countries, while encourag-ing authorities to continue structural reformsaimed at increasing their resiliency to

someinvestors, and that compression of inflationand risk premia leaves little room for error interms of asset valuations. against this back-drop, the risk that long-term market ratesmight rise abruptly requires continued vigi-lance. while no single event may trigger sucha rise, most directors highlighted concernsabout the possibility of a combination or cor-relation of events, noting the potential risks ofa disorderly adjustment of global imbalances,possibly associated with a diversification ofinternational investors away from dollar hold-ings, as well as the possibility of an unantici-pated increase in inflation, particularly relatedto oil and other commodity prices.directors considered a number of steps toenhance global financial stability and mitigatepotential risks. in particular, they reiteratedtheir call for cooperative efforts and crediblepolicy measures to enhance the market’s confi-dence that global imbalances will be reducedin an orderly manner. at a

relative to income,boosted by capital gains. at the same time, theshift away from bank and savings deposits tomore market-sensitive assets has also exposedthem to greater market risk. directors consid-ered that planned reforms of public and pri-vate retirement benefits may imply thathouseholds will have even more responsibilitygoing forward in managing their financialaffairs. such reforms have brought benefits,such as the portability of defined contributionor hybrid pension plans. while they havereduced some risks, these reforms have alsoincreased the direct exposure of householdsto investment and market risks, and possiblymore challenging, longevity risk.directors observed that as more householdsrely primarily on defined contribution andother self-directed pension plans, there maybe scope for incentives to educate households,and thereby increase their ability to managethese risks and to obtain better financialadvice. these measures could also includedeveloping new instruments to help house-holds realize more easily long-term savingsand make resources available for retirement.several directors highlighted the role of con-sistent government policies, including stabletax policies, in encouraging long-term savingsstrategies. a crucial element of household sav-ing and investment planning is the uncer-tainty of life expectancy, and the ability toconvert long-term savings into a dependableincome stream. directors suggested, in thiscontext, that the issuance of long-dated,index-linked, and longevity bonds could facili-tate the management of longer-term invest-ments and obligations and the supply ofannuity products.directors generally saw a role for govern-ments in developing communication strate-gies to inform households about theirretirement challenges, and in coordinatingwith the private sector to provide financialeducation. they welcomed the initiativesundertaken by organizations such as theoecd and several national authorities to fos-ter the financial education of households.directors noted the importance of increasedefforts to improve the collection, timeliness,and comparability of data on the householdsector for assessing the flow of financial riskthrough the financial system, and in particularthe risk profile of households. more generally,they looked forward to keeping the systemicand policy implications of the flow of risks tohouseholds under review.corporate finance in emerging marketsdirectors welcomed the detailed study oncorporate finance in emerging markets. theyobserved that it is unclear whether the declinein domestic bank lending to corporations(outside china and india) is a result ofreduced external financing needs or con-straints on the sources of funding. neverthe-less, directors called for continued efforts byemerging markets to improve their institu-tional frameworks to facilitate corporates’access to equity finance on appropriate terms.directors saw a need to narrow gaps in theimplementation and enforcement of widelyaccepted principles of corporate governance,disclosure and transparency, while recognizingthe need to take into account country-specificlegal and institutional circumstances as well asthe stage of market development. severaldirectors saw merit in integrating the analysisand discussion on corporate finance and bankdisintermediation across mature

ratios to more manageable levels.household balance sheetsdirectors welcomed the staff’s study on thechanging risk profile of the household sectorresulting from the transfer, reallocation, andimproved management of financial risks bybanks, insurance companies, and pensionfunds. while households always have been theultimate bearers of financial risks, through avariety of channels, these risks traditionallyhave been intermediated by governments andprivate financial and nonfinancial institutions.directors supported the view that policiesdesigned to improve the financial stability ofsystemically or otherwise important institu-tions should also consider the consequentflow of risks to households and their ability toabsorb or manage such risks.directors observed that trends in the evolu-tion of household balance sheets in differentjurisdictions have benefited households in var-summing up by the acting chair141ious ways, including through a significantgrowth in net worth relative to income,boosted by capital gains. at the same time, theshift away from bank and savings deposits tomore market-sensitive assets has also exposedthem to greater market risk. directors consid-ered that planned reforms of public and pri-vate retirement benefits may imply thathouseholds will have even more responsibilitygoing forward in managing their financialaffairs. such reforms have brought benefits,such as the portability of defined contributionor hybrid pension plans. while they havereduced some risks, these reforms have alsoincreased the direct exposure of householdsto investment and market risks, and possiblymore challenging, longevity risk.directors observed that as more householdsrely primarily on defined contribution andother self-directed pension plans, there maybe scope for incentives to educate households,and thereby increase their ability to managethese risks and to obtain better financialadvice. these measures could also includedeveloping new instruments to help house-holds realize more easily long-term savingsand make resources available for retirement.several directors highlighted the role of con-sistent government policies, including stabletax policies, in encouraging long-term savingsstrategies. a crucial element of household sav-ing and investment planning is the uncer-tainty of life expectancy, and the ability toconvert long-term savings into a dependableincome stream. directors suggested, in thiscontext, that the issuance of long-dated,index-linked, and longevity bonds could facili-tate the management of longer-term invest-ments and obligations and the supply ofannuity products.directors generally saw a role for govern-ments in developing communication strate-gies to inform households about theirretirement challenges, and in coordinatingwith the private sector to provide financialeducation. they welcomed the initiativesundertaken by organizations such as theoecd and several national authorities to fos-ter the financial education of households.directors noted the importance of increasedefforts to improve the collection, timeliness,and comparability of data on the householdsector for assessing the flow of financial riskthrough the financial system, and in particularthe risk profile of households. more generally,they looked forward to keeping the systemicand policy implications of the flow of risks tohouseholds under review.corporate finance in emerging marketsdirectors welcomed the detailed study oncorporate finance in emerging markets. theyobserved that it is unclear whether the declinein domestic bank lending to corporations(outside china and india) is a result ofreduced external financing needs or con-straints on the sources of funding. neverthe-less, directors called for continued efforts byemerging markets to improve their institu-tional frameworks to facilitate corporates’access to equity finance on appropriate terms.directors saw a need to narrow gaps in theimplementation and enforcement of widelyaccepted principles of corporate governance,disclosure and transparency, while recognizingthe need to take into account country-specificlegal and institutional circumstances as well asthe stage of market development. severaldirectors saw merit in integrating the analysisand discussion on corporate finance and bankdisintermediation across mature and emerg-ing markets, as common trends are likely inan integrated global economy.directors recognized the importance ofassessing corporate sector financial fragilities,given the increased importance of corporatesrelative to sovereigns in international marketsand the potential risks should market condi-tions become less benign. they underscoredthe desirability of an integrated approach tocorporate sector vulnerability that wouldaccount for interactions between interest rate,foreign exchange and credit risks, as well asannex summing up by the acting chair142summing up by the acting chair143linkages with the financial and governmentsectors. while the effort to develop new data-bases was welcomed, some directors neverthe-less cautioned that care should be taken indrawing inferences from dated and incom-plete data. some directors encouraged thedevelopment of hedging instruments toaddress exposures to foreign currency risk,and also noted the important role of financialintermediaries, and their regulators, in moni-toring balance sheet mismatches in the corpo-rate sector.']\",\n",

broader and more systematictransparency of exposures and practices.directors noted that future staff work willsumming up by the acting chair159focus on the hedge fund and pension fundindustries.directors welcomed the conclusion of thestaff’s analysis that the reallocation of creditrisk to the insurance sector, together withimprovements in risk management in the sec-tor, appears to have contributed to enhancedoverall financial stability. moreover, by allocat-ing a greater share of their portfolio to creditinstruments, many life insurers avail them-selves of a more predictable return. while theinvestment in credit instruments by insurersdeserves to be supported, directors stressedthat this will need to go hand in hand withcontinued efforts to improve risk manage-ment and regulatory oversight of the sector.areas for improvement highlighted bydirectors include: wider implementation ofrisk-based capital standards by regulators;enhancement of supervisory resources inmany mature market jurisdictions; increasedinformation sharing among supervisors; andstrengthened disclosure requirements.directors welcomed the current debate oninternational accounting standards for insur-ers, and looked forward to the developmentof converging standards that provide an accu-rate reflection of insurance companies’ finan-cial position. to be adequate, disclosureshould be comprehensive, and include infor-mation on sensitivities and risks. while ratingagencies play a helpful role in disseminatinginformation on risks, directors cautioned thatthey should not be relied upon as a substitutefor appropriate supervision.institutional investors inemerging marketsdirectors welcomed the discussion of theinstitutional investor base for claims on emerg-ing markets. they saw the development of astable investor base as a key element in reduc-ing the volatility of capital flows to emergingmarkets. while ongoing changes are con-tributing to a welcome broadening and diver-sification of the investor base, directorsobserved that the decline in dedicated, rela-tive to crossover, investors may also haveincreased the volatility of capital flows.another source of potential volatility arisesfrom the impact that even small changes inthe portfolio positions of institutionalinvestors can have on emerging markets, giventhe large size of the assets under managementof these investors. directors agreed that thefactors influencing the changing nature of theinvestor base, as well as their policy implica-tions—including for debt management poli-cies and practices in emerging markets—willrequire continued careful analysis. theyemphasized the importance of adequate trans-parency and disclosure regarding both govern-ment policies and corporate developments,with investor relations programs being a par-ticularly useful instrument. in addition, thedevelopment of an efficient market infrastruc-ture within emerging markets will be helpfulin attracting institutional investors from bothmature and domestic markets.directors also commented on the supervi-sory and regulatory implications of theexpanding portfolios of nonbank institutionalinvestors in emerging markets, in particularthe rapid growth of pension funds. theynoted that, in view of the growing imbalancebetween the assets under management ofthese funds and the available securities, closecoordination will be required betweenchanges in the regulatory framework, thedevelopment of local capital markets, and thegradual easing of limits on foreign invest-ments by pension funds to increase theiropportunities for portfolio diversification.directors viewed the development of localsecurities markets as key to ensuring properrisk management by the insurance industry. inview of the rapid growth and increasingsophistication of the activities of local institu-tional investors involved in both local andinternational markets, it will also be importantto persevere with strong efforts to enhancethe risk management skills of both investorsand regulators.annex summing up by the acting chair160']\",\n",

lessons about the amplifying mecha-nisms that could lead to instability, for exam-ple, by forcing or creating incentives for salesinto falling markets.directors noted that amplifying factorscould take

directors welcomed theopportunity to discuss the global finan-cial situation and prospects. theybroadly agreed with the staff’s assess-ment that financial markets had remainedresilient during 2003, notwithstanding contin-ued lackluster economic growth, geopoliticaluncertainties, and high market volatility.however, they noted that some concernsremain, associated with risks related to themacroeconomic outlook, rising long-termbond yields, the potential for weak corporateearnings, and the vulnerability of emergingbond markets to a correction.recent developments and risksdirectors noted that further progress con-tinued to be made by different sectors of themature market economies in addressing theeffects of the bursting of the equity price bub-ble. household and corporate balance sheetscontinued to improve, as these sectors builtup liquidity further and locked in fixed-rateborrowing at longer maturities. in addition,banks’ balance sheets generally strengthenedas corporate defaults declined and earningsbegan to recover. many directors alsoobserved that the improved balance sheetpositions of corporations placed them in abetter position to contribute to the global eco-nomic recovery by increasing investmentspending.directors agreed that historically low policyinterest rates in the major financial centershad helped improve financial soundness. atthe same time, low interest rates hadprompted a search for yield in early 2003 thathad led investors to be increasingly willing totake on credit risk and market risk, which hadleft those investors vulnerable to an upturn inlonger-term yields. flows had also beenattracted to higher-yielding emerging markets,allowing many borrowers from these marketsto complete their borrowing programs for2003. in addition, international equity mar-kets had recovered since march.directors agreed that the rebound in bondyields in major markets since mid-june hadbeen accentuated by the unwinding of carrytrades and other technical factors, including alarge volume of hedging of exposures in theu.s. mortgage market. many directors notedthat there were signs that credit spreads oncorporate and emerging market bonds mighthave become compressed, making them vul-nerable to further increases in governmentbond yields, and that a rotation of funds awayfrom fixed-income instruments and towardequities could make financing more difficultfor emerging market borrowers.directors noted that, ultimately, a furthersteepening of government bond yield curvescould, on balance, be positive for financialmarkets, including the emerging markets, if itwere driven by prospects of faster economicgrowth. stronger growth would allow furtherimprovements in the balance sheets of firmsand households, while higher yields wouldbenefit financial institutions. meanwhile, lowshort-term rates could contribute to furtherbalance sheet repair and underpin investors’risk appetite. directors cautioned, however,that there were risks in the transition toconcluding remarks by the chairmanthe following remarks by the chairman were made at the conclusion of the executiveboard’s discussion of the global financial stability

important countries.directors observed that in the householdsector a further sharp increase in bond yieldswould prompt steep falls in mortgage refi-nancing in the united states. this wouldreduce

sources of volatility in thesupply of funds to emerging markets.directors pointed out that, while volatilityof capital flows seemed somewhat inevitable,sound economic policies and transparencycould help to make flows more stable. therewas also much that emerging countries coulddo to “self-insure” themselves against theeffects of volatility, including through assetand liability management; adapting exchangerate arrangements to the degree of capitalaccount openness; strengthening domesticfinancial institutions; enhancing supervisionand regulation; and developing local securi-ties markets. some directors also felt thatself-insurance efforts might also be comple-mented by increased holdings of internationalreserves. directors noted that developing effi-cient and stable local sources of finance hadbecome all the more relevant now that emerg-ing markets as a group had become netexporters of capital in recent years.looking ahead, directors saw merit infuture staff work in

in the financial markets and that theyhave access to full and accurate informationon the health of publicly traded firms. thecontinuation of ongoing efforts to improvecorporate governance, accounting,

stablesource of funding for domestic corporationsand the public sector, and stimulate domesticsavings by broadening the set of investmentopportunities. among the core policies to pro-mote the development and ensure the smoothfunctioning of local securities markets,directors highlighted measures to improvemarket infrastructure and transparency,strengthen corporate governance, develop liq-uid benchmarks, and promote a domesticinstitutional investor base. a few directorsnoted the supportive role that foreign directinvestment in the financial sector can play inthis regard. directors stressed that steps todevelop local securities markets need carefulsequencing, with the development of moneymarkets typically being a crucial first step indeveloping bond and derivatives markets. inthis connection, a suggestion was also madethat country case studies could help guide thedevelopment of local securities markets.directors cautioned against heavy resort tobonds indexed to foreign currencies, whichcould increase vulnerability to external shocksand contribute to unstable debt structures.however, inflation-indexed bonds can be auseful instrument to deepen local bond mar-kets. while local derivatives markets can facili-tate the management of financial risk,directors stressed that the development ofsuch markets needs to be based on a strongsupervisory and regulatory foundation.although local securities and derivativesmarkets have grown substantially over the lastyears, directors observed that they have notyet developed enough to provide full insur-ance against

       " \"['132summing up by the chairman assessment of financial stability andpolicy implicationsdirectors welcomed the continued resilienceof the global financial system, which has beensupported by solid global growth, low infla-tion, abundant liquidity, and flat yield curves.they considered that financial conditions willlikely remain benign in the most likely sce-nario of continued growth, contained infla-tion, and stable inflationary expectations. atthe same time, directors noted that the globalfinancial system faces a number of challenges,in particular rising interest rates and a turn inthe credit cycle for both the corporate andhousehold sectors. given the strengthenedresilience of the financial system, mostdirectors considered that financial marketsshould be able to deal quite

economic performance and debtmanagement, which would provide a bufferagainst an expected moderate deterioration ofexternal financing conditions. in particular, thelarge current account surpluses and

deterioration in external financingconditions. directors also noted that the com-position of the emerging market investor baseis becoming more diverse, with the increasedpresence of strategic and

immediate concerns over a slowdown in china have eased on the back of policy measures to shore up growth.in advanced economies, weaker growth was miti-gated by the prospect of further monetary accommo-dation, which supported asset prices and spurred some recovery in risk appetites. the shock of brexit—the june 2016 u.k. referendum result in favor of leav-ing the european union—initially

normalizing monetary policy. the political climate is unsettled in many countries. a lack of income growth and a rise in inequality have opened the door for populist, inward-looking policies. these developments make it even harder to tackle legacy prob-lems, further expose economies and markets to shocks, and raise the risk of a gradual slide into economic and financial stagnation. in such a state, financial institu-tions struggle to sustain healthy balance sheets, which weakens economic growth and financial stability. financial institutions in advanced economies face a number of cyclical and structural challenges and need to adapt to this new era of low growth and low interest rates, as well as to an evolving market and regulatory environment. these are significant challenges that affect large parts of the financial system, and if unaddressed could undermine financial soundness. • weak profitability could erode banks’ buffers over time and undermine their ability to support growth. this report finds that a cyclical recovery will not resolve the problem of low profitability. over 25\\\\xa0percent of banks in advanced economies (about $11.7 trillion in assets) would remain weak and face significant structural challenges. more deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for european banks. japanese banks also face significant business model challenges. these banks are expanding abroad to offset thin margins and weak domestic demand, but this exposes them to greater dollar funding risks. a disruption of dol-lar funding sources could force japanese banks to curtail their offshore lending and investment.• the solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates. low interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from aging populations and low or volatile asset returns. heightened concern over these important long-term-saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.emerging markets are also adapting to an envi-ronment of lower global growth, lower commodity prices, and reduced global trade. the current favorable external environment, including low interest rates and the global search for investment opportunities, presents an opportunity for overly indebted firms to restructure their balance sheets. corporate leverage in many of these markets may be peaking, since firms have slashed investment in the wake of

circumstances. • shoring up life insurers and pension funds remains critical. sustained low growth and low interest rates raise significant challenges for long-term investment and savings institutions such as life insurers and pension funds. regulators and supervisors should act promptly to sustain the strength of insurance and pension fund balance sheets, including identify-ing medium-term insolvency risks and funding gaps, while enhancing the reform agenda to strengthen standards for internal models and capital frame-works and improve transparency. emerging market economies should take advantage of supportive external conditions to proactively moni-tor and address corporate vulnerabilities, particu-larly those arising from excess leverage and foreign exchange exposures. actions are needed on three fronts: (1) managing the impact of corporate distress, through swift and transparent recognition of nonper-forming loans and strengthening insolvency frame-works; (2) boosting oversight and response capacity through reforms to macroprudential and supervisory frameworks; and (3) ensuring continued access to international financial services, including through strengthened regulatory and supervisory regimes that help lower risk perceptions, including those support-ing correspondent banking activity. the chinese authorities’ latest reform efforts have led to more balanced growth and a greater role for market forces, improving the resilience of the chinese economy and financial system. nonetheless, china’s corporate debt overhang and other growing financial sector vulnerabilities must be addressed promptly through a comprehensive approach to facilitate deleveraging and upgrade the supervisory framework. curbing excessive credit growth, including in the form of riskier shadow credit products, and ensuring sound interbank funding structures would reduce the potential for system stress and spillovers. global institutions have a role to play in promoting inclusive growth and encouraging an open dialogue on globalization. most countries would reap macro-economic growth benefits from greater access by firms and individuals to banking services. closing gender gaps in account usage and promoting diversity in the depositor base can have broader economic benefits while creating opportunities for the disadvantaged. monetary policy impact changing, but not weakened by growth in nonbank financinga notable change in global financial markets in the past decade has been the rise of nonbank financial inter-mediaries such as asset managers, insurance companies, and pension funds. although concerns have been voiced about a decline in the effectiveness of monetary policy given the growing role of nonbank financing, these fears appear to be unfounded. indeed, chapter 2 finds that, on average, monetary policy transmission seems to be stronger in economies with larger nonbank financial sectors. nonbanks tend to contract their balance sheets even more than banks when monetary policy tightens—a behavior partly explained by the effect of monetary policy on risk taking. low interest rates have probably created the condi-tions for more risk taking by both bank and nonbank financial intermediaries. however, the conjunction of weak bank balance sheets and stronger bank regulation could mean that nonbanks now play a more important role in the transmission of monetary policy because the risk-taking channel of monetary policy has gained importance and asset managers have assumed a greater role in financial intermediation. as a result, the effects of monetary policy changes on the real economy may become more rapid and marked. this suggests the need for greater vigilance by prudential and regulatory authorities and for central banks to continuously recali-brate the dosage and timing of monetary policy actions as their impact and the speed of their transmission change—particularly in an environment characterized by new challenges to financial stability.given the growth of the nonbank financial sector, the information contained in the balance sheets of nonbanks is potentially at least as useful as traditional measures of monetary aggregates. in this context, improving data collection on nonbanks is essential. international monetary fund | october 2016 ixshort-term risks have abatedshort-term risks to global financial

low-growth, low-rate erafurther corporate governance reform in emerging market economies would help enhance resilience to shockshas institutional progress in emerging market econ-omies—including corporate governance and investor protection—kept pace with their international finan-cial integration in building their resilience to external shocks? chapter 3 finds that corporate governance and investor protection have generally improved in emerg-ing market economies over the past two decades. these improvements are visible both at the firm level and at the country level. even so, there are important differ-ences across emerging market economies, and there is room for further improvement. the analysis shows that stronger corporate governance and investor protection frameworks enhance the resil-ience of emerging market economies to global finan-cial shocks—an issue of particular importance in the new phase the global financial system is entering. for example, equity price declines in the wake of brexit were relatively larger in emerging market economies with lower corporate governance standards. corporate gov-ernance improvements enhance stock market efficiency and foster deeper and more liquid capital markets, allowing them to absorb shocks better. emerging market economies with better corporate governance generally also have more resilient corporate balance sheets. policies to further bolster the rights of outside inves-tors, especially minority shareholders; bring disclosure requirements fully in line with international best practice; and promote greater board independence are likely to yield financial stability benefits.']\",\n",

market com-panies and banks. these firms have become more susceptible to financial stress, economic downturn, and capital outflows. deteriorating corporate health runs the risk of deepening the sovereign-corporate and the corporate-bank nexus in some key emerging markets. china in particular faces a delicate bal-ance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing financial vulnerabilities and moving toward a more market-based system—a challenging set of objectives. recent market developments, including slumping commodity prices, china’s bursting equity and margin-lending bubble, falling emerging market equities, and pressure on exchange rates, underscore these challenges. • legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies—high public and private debt in advanced economies and remaining gaps in the euro area architecture need to be addressed to consolidate financial stabil-ity, and avoid political tensions and headwinds to confidence and growth. in the euro area, addressing remaining sovereign and banking vulnerabilities is still a challenge. • weak systemic market liquidity—this poses a chal-lenge in adjusting to new equilibria in markets and the wider economy. extraordinarily accommodative policies have contributed to a compression of risk pre-miums across a range of markets including sovereign bonds and corporate credit, as well as a compression of liquidity and equity risk premiums. while recent market developments have unwound some of this compression, risk premiums could still rise further. now that the federal reserve looks set to begin the gradual process of tightening monetary policy, the global financial system faces an unprecedented adjust-ment as risk premiums “normalize” from historically low levels alongside rising policy rates and a modest cyclical recovery. abnormal market conditions will need to adjust smoothly to the new environment. but there are risks from a rapid decompression, particu-larly given what appears to be more brittle market structures and market fragilities concentrated in credit intermediation channels, which could come to the fore as financial conditions normalize (see chapter 2). indeed, recent episodes of high market volatility and liquidity dislocations across advanced and emerging market asset classes highlight this challenge.strong policy actions are needed to ensure “successful normalization”the relatively weak baseline for both financial stabil-ity and the economic outlook leaves risks tilted to the downside. thus, ensuring successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions and a smooth handover to higher growth requires further policy efforts to tackle pressing challenges. these should include the following: • continued effort by the federal reserve to provide clear and consistent communication, enabling the smooth absorption of rising u.s. rates, which is essential for global financial health. • in the euro area, more progress in strengthening the financial architecture of the common currency to bolster market and business confidence. addressing the overhang of private debt and bank nonperform-ing loans in the euro area would support bank finance and corporate health, and boost investment. • rebalancing and gradual deleveraging in china, which will require great care and strong commit-ments to market-based reforms and further strength-ening of the financial system. • more broadly, addressing both cyclical and structural challenges in emerging markets, which will be criti-cal to underpin improved prospects and resilience. authorities in emerging markets should regularly monitor corporate foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions, and use micro- and macroprudential tools to discourage the buildup of excessive leverage and foreign indebtedness. • safeguarding against market illiquidity and strength-ening market structures, which are priorities, espe-cially in advanced economies’ markets. • ensuring the soundness and health of banks and the long-term savings complex (for example, insurers and pension funds), which is critical, as highlighted in the april 2015 gfsr. international monetary fund | october 2015 ixfinancial stability has improved in advanced economiesfinancial stability has improved in advanced economies since the april 2015 global financial stability report. this progress reflects a strengthening macrofinancial environment in advanced economies as the recovery has broadened, confidence in monetary policies has firmed, and deflation risks have abated somewhat in the euro area. the federal reserve is poised to raise interest rates as the preconditions for liftoff are nearly in place. this increase should help slow the further buildup of excesses in financial risk taking. partly due to confidence in the european central bank’s (ecb’s) policies, credit conditions are improving and credit demand is pick-ing up. corporate sectors are showing tentative signs of improvement that could spawn increased investment and economic risk taking, including in the united states and japan, albeit from low levels. risks continue to rotate toward emerging markets, amid greater market liquidity risksdespite these improvements in advanced economies, emerging market vulnerabilities remain elevated, risk appetite has fallen, and market liquidity risks are higher. although many emerging market economies have enhanced their policy frameworks and resilience to external shocks, several key economies face substantial domestic imbalances and lower growth, as noted in the october 2015 world economic outlook (weo). many emerging market economies relied on rapid credit creation to sidestep the worst impacts of the global crisis. this increased borrowing has resulted in sharply higher leverage of the private sector in many economies, par-ticularly in cyclical sectors, accompanied by rising foreign currency exposures increasingly driven by global factors. this confluence of borrowing and foreign currency expo-sure has increased the sensitivity of these economies to a tightening of global financial conditions (see chapter 3).as emerging market economies approach the late stage of the credit cycle, banks have thinner capital cushions, while nonperforming loans are set to rise as corporate earnings and asset quality deteriorate. in china, banks have only recently begun to address the growing asset quality challenges associated with rising weaknesses in key areas of the corporate sector. these developments in emerging market banking systems stand in contrast to those in advanced economies, where banks have spent the past few years deleverag-ing and repairing balance sheets, raising capital, and strengthening funding arrangements. against a challenging backdrop of falling commod-ity prices and weaker growth, several emerging market sovereigns are at greater risk of losing investment-grade ratings in the medium term. pressures on sovereign ratings could intensify if contingent liabilities of state-owned enterprises—with a large and rising share of emerging market corporate bond issuance—have to be assumed by the sovereign, for example, from firms in the oil, gas, and utility sectors. policymakers confront a triad of challengesthe baseline outlook for financial stability, consistent with the october 2015 weo, is characterized by continuing cyclical recovery, but with weak prospects for medium-term growth in both advanced econo-mies and emerging markets. in advanced economies, improvements in private balance sheets and continued accommodative monetary and financial conditions have spurred a cyclical recovery, but the handover to higher levels of self-sustaining growth is incomplete. emerging markets face substantial challenges in adjust-ing to the new global market realities from a position of higher vulnerability.successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions would bring macrofinancial benefits and considerably reduce downside risks. this report ana-lyzes the prospects for normalization according to three scenarios: the baseline, an upside scenario of successful normalization, and a downside scenario characterized by disruptions in global asset markets. against this backdrop, the global financial outlook is clouded by a triad of broad policy challenges in evidence over the past several months: x international monetary fund | october 2015global financial stability report: vulnerabilities, legacies, and policy challenges: risks rotating to emerging markets• emerging market vulnerabilities—as examined in the weo, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is projected to decline for the fifth year in a row. many emerging markets have increased their resilience to external shocks with increased exchange rate flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on fdi flows and domestic-currency external financing, and generally stronger policy frameworks. but balance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market com-panies and banks. these firms have become more susceptible to financial stress, economic downturn, and capital outflows. deteriorating corporate health runs the risk of deepening the sovereign-corporate and the corporate-bank nexus in some key emerging markets. china in particular faces a delicate bal-ance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing financial vulnerabilities and moving toward a more market-based system—a challenging set of objectives. recent market developments, including slumping commodity prices, china’s bursting equity and margin-lending bubble, falling emerging market equities, and pressure on exchange rates, underscore these challenges. • legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies—high public and private debt in advanced economies and remaining gaps in the euro area architecture need to be addressed to consolidate financial stabil-ity, and avoid political tensions and headwinds to confidence and growth. in the euro area, addressing remaining sovereign and banking vulnerabilities is still a challenge. • weak systemic market liquidity—this poses a chal-lenge in adjusting to new equilibria in markets and the wider economy.

international monetary fund | october 2015 xiwith bold and upgraded financial policy actions detailed in the report, policymakers can help deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability, while avoiding downside risks. such an upside scenario would benefit the world economy and raise global output 0.4 percent above the baseline by 2018. further growth-enhancing structural reforms, detailed in the weo, could bring additional support to growth and stability, beyond the benefits detailed here.possible shocks or policy missteps could lead to a global asset market disruptionwithout the implementation of policies to ensure successful normalization, potential adverse shocks or policy missteps could trigger an abrupt rise in market risk premiums and a rapid erosion of policy confidence. shocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sud-den drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes. under these conditions, a significant—even if tempo-rary—mispricing of assets may ensue, with negative repercussions on financial stability (see chapter 2).in such an adverse scenario, substantially tighter financial conditions could stall the cyclical recovery and weaken confidence in medium-term growth prospects. low nominal growth would put pressure on debt-laden sovereign and private balance sheets, raising credit risks. emerging markets would face higher global risk premiums and substantial capital outflows, putting particular pressure on economies with domestic imbalances. corporate default rates would rise, particularly in china, raising financial system strains, with implications for growth. these events would lead to a reappearance of risks on sover-eign balance sheets, especially in europe’s vulnerable economies, and the emergence of an adverse feedback loop between corporate and sovereign risks in emerg-ing markets. as a result, aggregate global output could be as much as 2.4 percent lower by 2017, relative to the baseline. this implies lower but still positive global growth.']\",\n",

number of financial institutions. weak european mid-sized life insurers face a high and rising risk of distress—stress tests (conducted by the european insurance and occupational pensions authority) show that 24 percent of insurers may not be able to meet their solvency capital requirements under a prolonged low interest rate scenario. the industry has a portfolio of €4.4 trillion in assets in the european union, with high and rising interconnectedness with the wider financial system, creating a potential source of spillovers. high debt levels in the private sector continue to hinder growth

the assumptions for growth and inflation in this report sug-gest that private sector debt levels in a number of major advanced economies will remain high. this continuing high debt calls for an additional response to address the crisis legacies and unshackle economic potential. gross corporate debt in france, italy, portugal, and spain is expected to remain above or near 70 percent of gdp by

many emerging market economies, provid-ing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. however, oil- and commodity-exporting countries and countries with high foreign indebtedness face more formidable risks. although the stronger dollar can help improve competitiveness in emerging market economies in general, and lead to higher growth, the dramatic movements in commodity prices and in the exchange rates of many emerging market economies during the past six months have already had a significant impact on firms’ market valuations in these economies. many companies borrowed heavily in international markets—substituting international borrowings in dollars for local currency borrowing from banks—potentially leading to balance sheet pressures. in turn, a retrenchment of overinvested industries, real estate sector adjustments, and property price declines—especially in china—could spill over to emerging markets more broadly. the broader impact of a sudden deterioration in corporate health on banking system stability depends on credit exposures. in china, exposures to real estate (excluding mortgages) are almost 20 percent of gdp , and financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spill-overs, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. in 11 of the 21 emerging market banking systems analyzed in this report, more than

of additional policies are required to increase policy traction and ground stability this report assesses the policy responses of cen-tral banks in both advanced and emerging market economies. a key message is that additional policy measures—beyond monetary policies—are required to make a well-grounded exit from the crisis. poli-cies must address crisis legacies and facilitate sustain-able economic risk taking while containing financial excesses across global markets. to maximize the impact of quantitative easing in the euro area, central bank actions must be comple-mented with measures to restore balance sheet health in the private sector, unclog credit channels, enhance the soundness of nonbank institutions, and promote structural reforms. in particular, • unclogging credit channels requires comprehensive actions to tackle the burden of nonperforming loans. despite improving bank resilience in the wake of the ecb’s comprehensive assessment and introduction of the single supervisory mechanism, asset quality continues to deteriorate, although at a slowing pace, with total nonperforming loans now standing at more than €900 billion. banks should be encouraged to develop and use specialized internal and external capacity for handling the stock of nonperforming assets, actively manage their provisions, and write off their nonperforming assets. further efforts are needed to improve the effectiveness of legal frame-works governing bankruptcy of companies and individuals. without corrective policy actions, bank lending capacity could be limited to a meager 1 to 3 percent on average a year.• the challenges facing life insurers should also be tackled promptly. regulators need to reassess the via-bility of guarantee-based products and work to bring minimum return guarantees offered to policyholders in line with secular trends in policy rates. prompt regulatory and supervisory actions are needed to mitigate damaging spillovers from potential difficul-ties of individual insurers. the introduction of a more harmonized safety net would further increase the industry’s resilience.• sources of funding need to be diversified away from banks and toward capital markets. despite the surge in capital market borrowings, they represent only about 36 percent of the system. a deeper and broader capital market would improve access to finance, par-ticularly for smaller firms, and make financial markets more efficient. in the euro area, encouraging the use of capital markets requires harmonization of com-pany law, corporate governance, insolvency regimes, and taxation, in line with the latest capital markets union proposal by the european commission.in japan the effectiveness of quantitative easing depends on the policies supporting it. steadfast imple-mentation of abenomics’ second and third arrows (fiscal and structural reforms) is essential. if these reforms are incomplete, efforts to pull the economy out of deflation are less likely to succeed. the bank of japan should consider strengthening the portfolio rebalancing effects of its asset purchases by increasing the share of private assets in purchases and extending the program to longer-maturity government bonds, as necessary, to achieve its 2 percent inflation target. to further stimulate bank lending to the private sector, the authorities should expand special lending facili-ties; jumpstart the securitization market for small and medium enterprise credits and mortgages; and enhance risk capital provision, including by encouraging more asset-based lending and removing barriers to entry and exit for small and medium enterprises.in the united states, the impact of global market forces requires appropriately balanced policies, includ-ing continued clear

and negative macroeconomic and financial developments have occurred in the past six months. on a net basis, these developments have increased financial stability risks.on the positive side, as discussed in the april 2015 world economic outlook, growth in 2015 is expected to be slightly higher than that of 2014, improving in advanced economies enough to offset slower growth in emerging market and developing economies. sharply lower oil and commodity prices, coupled with lower interest rates from expanded monetary accommodation, are expected to support growth through 2016. bold monetary policy actions have been taken in both the euro area and japan to arrest and reverse disinflation-ary pressures. quantitative easing provides a strong framework for addressing deflation risks, and some key transmission channels are already working. spreads on credit have narrowed in the euro area, equity prices have surged, and the euro and yen have depreciated significantly, helping to raise inflation expectations. at the same time, the u.s. dollar has appreciated substantially, reflecting diverging monetary policies. the dollar has strengthened more against major currencies during the past nine months than it has during any similar period since 1981. the resulting movements in real exchange rates have broadly reflected changes in growth prospects and exposures to lower oil prices, and should help support the global recovery.however, the financial stability risks around this baseline are rising and rotating. although the benefits of the improving baseline are widely distributed and accrue over time, the adverse impact of recent shocks is concen-trated and is already affecting sectors and economies with preexisting vulnerabilities. meanwhile, continued financial risk taking and structural changes in credit markets are shifting the locus of financial stability risks from advanced economies to emerging markets, from banks to shadow banks, and from solvency to market liquidity risks.• continued financial risk taking and search for yield keep stretching some asset valuations. the low inter-est rate environment also poses challenges for long-term investors, particularly for weaker life insurance companies in europe.• oil- and commodity-exporting countries and firms have been severely affected by falling asset valuations and rising credit risks. energy and commodity firms in emerging markets, which account for more than a third of nonfinancial corporate bonds issued in hard currency since 2007, have been particularly hard hit. strains in the debt-repayment capacity of the oil and gas sector have become more evident for firms in argentina, brazil, nigeria, and south africa because of low oil prices, as well as for sovereigns reliant on oil revenues such as nigeria and venezuela.• rapidly depreciating exchange rates have increased pressures on firms that borrowed heavily in for-eign currencies and have sparked significant capital outflows for several emerging markets. these developments could add stress to emerging mar-ket sovereigns that have increased their combined exposure to foreign currency borrowings and foreign investor holdings of local currency debt.• volatility in major exchange rates has increased by more than during any similar period since the global financial crisis. reduced liquidity in both the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets, as well as the changing composition of the investor bases in these markets, has added frictions to portfolio adjustments. the resulting tensions in global finan-cial markets have increased market and liquidity risks, given that sudden episodes of volatility could become more common and more pronounced.existing legacy challenges add to these pressures, leav-ing overall financial stability risks higher.financial stability is not fully grounded in advanced economies, and risks have increased in many emerging marketslong-term bond yields in many advanced economies have decreased on disinflation concerns and the prospect of continued monetary accommodation. in the euro x international monetary fund | april 2015global financial stability report: navigating monetary policy challenges and managing risksarea, almost one-third of short- and long-term sovereign bonds now carry negative yields. but a prolonged low interest rate environment will pose severe challenges for a number of financial institutions. weak european mid-sized life insurers face a high and rising risk of distress—stress tests (conducted by the european insurance and occupational pensions authority) show that 24 percent of insurers may not be able to meet their solvency capital requirements under a prolonged low interest rate scenario. the industry has a portfolio of €4.4 trillion in assets in the european union, with high and rising interconnectedness with the wider financial system, creating a potential source of spillovers. high debt levels in the private sector continue to hinder growth and financial stability. accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies have helped reduce private sector debt ratios by supporting inflation and growth and by increasing asset prices. however, the assumptions for growth and inflation in this report sug-gest that private sector debt levels in a number of major advanced economies will remain high. this continuing high debt calls for an additional response to address the crisis legacies and unshackle economic potential. gross corporate debt in france, italy, portugal, and spain is expected to remain above or near 70 percent of gdp by 2020, and gross household debt in portugal and the united kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other major advanced economies. at the same time there is a clear upside risk to interest rates in the united states. t wo possible scenarios charac-terize the future normalization of u.s. monetary policy: a smooth well-telegraphed exit, or, despite clear com-munication, a bumpy ride with a more rapid decompres-sion of term premiums leading to rapidly rising yields and substantially higher volatility. indeed, declines in structural liquidity in fixed-income markets in both the united states and other economies have amplified asset price responses to shocks, increasing potential spillovers. technological change, increased regulation, and the shifting composition of market participants have altered the microstructure of fixed-income markets. illiquidity events now spill over to other asset classes and to emerg-ing markets, as witnessed in the u.s. t reasury market and in policy-induced instability in foreign exchange markets following the removal of the swiss franc floor. these developments highlight some key vulnerabilities in capital markets and the shadow banking system.emerging markets are caught in these global crosscur-rents, as they address their own domestic challenges. lower commodity prices and lower inflationary pressures are benefiting many emerging market economies, provid-ing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. however, oil- and commodity-exporting countries and countries with high foreign indebtedness face more formidable risks. although the stronger dollar can help improve competitiveness in emerging market economies in general, and lead to higher growth, the dramatic movements in commodity prices and in the exchange rates of many emerging market economies during the past six months have already had a significant impact on firms’ market valuations in these economies. many companies borrowed heavily in international markets—substituting international borrowings in dollars for local currency borrowing from banks—potentially leading to balance sheet pressures. in turn, a retrenchment of overinvested industries, real estate sector adjustments, and property price declines—especially in china—could spill over to emerging markets more broadly. the broader impact of a sudden deterioration in corporate health on banking system stability depends on credit exposures. in china, exposures to real estate (excluding mortgages) are almost 20 percent of gdp , and financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spill-overs, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. in 11 of the 21 emerging market banking systems analyzed in this report, more than half of the bank loan books consists of loans to firms, rendering them more exposed to corporate weakness, particularly in nigeria, peru, t urkey, and ukraine.in a downside risk scenario, further rapid dollar appreciation and an abrupt rise in u.s. interest rates, coupled with a rise in geopolitical risks, could put added pressure on emerging market currencies and asset markets. after a prolonged period of inflows, for-eign investors could abruptly reduce their holdings of local currency debt, thereby adding to turbulence and creating debt rollover challenges. markets also appear complacent when it comes to geopolitical and politi-cal risks. as noted in the april 2015 world economic outlook, ongoing events in russia and ukraine, the middle east, and parts of africa could lead to greater tensions and increased disruptions to global trade and financial transactions. direct financial linkages between russia and the rest of the world are limited, but the indirect connections with neighboring countries could raise financial stability risks. stronger institutional frameworks in the euro area have reduced the threat executive su mm ary international monetary fund | april 2015 xiof contagion from greece, but risks and vulnerabilities remain.a range of additional policies are required to increase policy traction and ground stability this report assesses the policy responses of cen-tral banks in both advanced and emerging market economies. a key message is that additional policy measures—beyond monetary policies—are required to make a well-grounded exit from the crisis. poli-cies must address crisis legacies and facilitate sustain-able economic risk taking while containing financial excesses across global markets. to maximize the impact of quantitative easing in the euro area, central bank actions must be comple-mented with measures to restore balance sheet health in the private sector, unclog credit channels, enhance the soundness of nonbank institutions, and promote structural reforms. in particular, • unclogging credit channels requires comprehensive actions to tackle the burden of nonperforming loans. despite improving bank resilience in the wake of the ecb’s comprehensive assessment and introduction of the single supervisory mechanism, asset quality continues to deteriorate, although at a slowing pace, with total nonperforming loans now standing at more than €900 billion. banks should be encouraged to develop and use specialized internal and external capacity for handling the stock of nonperforming assets, actively manage their provisions, and write off their nonperforming assets. further efforts are needed to improve the effectiveness of legal frame-works governing bankruptcy of companies and individuals. without corrective policy actions, bank lending capacity could be limited to a meager 1 to 3 percent on average a year.• the challenges facing life insurers should also be tackled promptly. regulators need to reassess the via-bility of guarantee-based products and work to bring minimum return guarantees offered to policyholders in line with secular trends in policy rates. prompt regulatory and supervisory actions are needed to mitigate damaging spillovers from potential difficul-ties of individual insurers. the introduction of a more harmonized safety net would further increase the industry’s resilience.• sources of funding need to be diversified away from banks and toward capital markets. despite the surge in capital market borrowings, they represent only about 36 percent of the system. a deeper and broader capital market would improve access to finance, par-ticularly for smaller firms, and make financial markets more efficient. in the euro area, encouraging the use of capital markets requires harmonization of com-pany law, corporate governance, insolvency regimes, and taxation, in line with the latest capital markets union proposal by the european commission.in japan the effectiveness of quantitative easing depends on the policies supporting it. steadfast imple-mentation of abenomics’ second and third arrows (fiscal and structural reforms) is essential. if these reforms are incomplete, efforts to pull the economy out of deflation are less likely to succeed. the bank of japan should consider strengthening the portfolio rebalancing effects of its asset purchases by increasing the share of private assets in purchases and extending the program to longer-maturity government bonds, as necessary, to achieve its 2 percent inflation target. to further stimulate bank lending to the private sector, the authorities should expand special lending facili-ties; jumpstart the securitization market for small and medium enterprise credits and mortgages; and enhance risk capital provision, including by encouraging more asset-based lending and removing barriers to entry and exit for small and medium enterprises.in the united states, the impact of global market forces requires appropriately balanced policies, includ-ing continued clear communication of monetary poli-cies. a smooth market adjustment will be more likely if there is extensive discussion and interpretation of key economic variables given that monetary policy is now data dependent. yet market expectations can differ from the federal reserve’s guidance, leading to market tensions and raising market and liquidity risks.in the united states and other economies with sig-nificant nonbank financial systems, addressing illiquidity and potential spillovers by strengthening market struc-tures will help enhance stability. as noted in chapter 3, the asset management industry needs stronger oversight that combines better microprudential supervision of risks with the adoption of a macroprudential orientation. policies should seek to address the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when redemptions must be met in times of stress. policies can help to accom-plish this objective by reducing asset owners’ incentives to run (by aligning funds’ redemption terms with the xii international monetary fund | april 2015global financial stability report: navigating monetary policy challenges and managing risksunderlying liquidity in the assets invested); enhancing the accuracy of net asset values; increasing liquidity cash buffers in mutual funds; and improving the liquidity and transparency of secondary markets, especially of longer-term debt markets. market participants in government bond and foreign exchange markets should also have greater incentives to provide secondary market liquid-ity. authorities should review current circuit breakers to enhance their functioning. risk management and control should be reinforced: supervisors should provide coor-dinated guidance to trading firms, allowing them to set consistent and appropriate risk limits on individual retail investors. regulators and monetary authorities should consider the correlation between asset classes when evalu-ating systemic risks in financial markets.emerging markets\\\\xa0should aim to cushion the impact of global headwinds and safeguard the resilience of their financial systems through enhanced surveillance of vulnerable sectors, particularly in the following areas:• in china, the overall priority must be to allow an orderly correction of excesses, curtailing the riskiest parts of shadow banking. at the same time, orderly deleveraging requires comprehensive policies that allow credit growth to slow gradually and, where necessary, the mechanisms to be provided for orderly corporate debt restructuring, and the exit of nonvi-able firms. • across emerging markets more generally, the large portion of debt denominated in foreign currencies means that micro- and macroprudential measures have important roles to play in limiting the risks from shocks. regulators need to conduct bank stress tests related to foreign currency and commodity price risks and more closely and regularly monitor corporate leverage and foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions.• to ensure markets function properly, authorities need to prepare for lapses of liquidity in local cur-rency bond markets. country authorities might potentially use cash balances when needed, or lower the supply of long-term debt to the market to help curtail bond spread increases. bilateral and multilateral swap line agreements, by providing foreign currency funding in times of stress, can enhance confidence and help reduce excess volatil-ity in currency markets. multilateral resources such as imf facilities could also provide additional buffers.the international financial regulatory reform agenda has strengthened regulatory frameworks, and is helping to make financial institutions and the global financial system more robust. global standard setters and national regulators now need to provide further clarity about regulatory standards—and thus improve certainty for banks adapting their business models—by finalizing the calibration of recent requirements, including the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, and total loss-absorbing capital requirements. promptly putting in place regulations to transform shadow banking into a stable source of market-based finance is also a must.at the same time, micro- and macroprudential policies for nonbanks should be strengthened. exist-ing regulatory frameworks may need to be reassessed to enable the authorities to better understand the less closely regulated corners of the financial sector that could cause problems for the banking system and the broader economy, and act as needed to mitigate identi-fied vulnerabilities. changes in international banking models have reduced risks in host financial systemson a more positive note, chapter 2, which examines changes in international banking since the global finan-cial crisis, finds that these changes are likely to promote more stable bank lending in host countries. it also finds a need for more international cooperation for dealing with regional or global shocks to maximize the benefits of cross-border banking while mitigating risks. international banks, especially those in europe, have reduced their cross-border lending, while local loans by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks abroad have remained steady. local and regional banks have stepped in to offset, at least partially, euro area banks’ reduction in exposure to some regions. as a result, intraregional linkages have deepened, in particular in asia. regulatory changes and weaknesses in bank balance sheets have contributed significantly in the past to the observed cutback in cross-border lending, whereas accommodative monetary policies may have slowed the cutback.the relative shift from cross-border lending to more local lending by affiliates should improve the finan-cial stability of host countries. cross-border lending flows are more sensitive to global shocks than are local lending and international portfolio flows. cross-border lending also tends to amplify the effect of

the parent bank is well capitalized and less dependent on nondeposit funding sources. however, restrictions on cross-border lending may jeopardize other benefits not examined in the chapter.oversight of asset managers must be proportional to the risks they pose to the financial systemchapter 3 finds that the asset management industry needs to strengthen its oversight framework in two key areas: better microprudential supervision of risks and adoption of some macroprudential concerns as a stan-dard part of its orientation. asset management firms can provide credit to the real economy even when banks are distressed, and they have certain advantages over banks from a financial stability perspective. how-ever, the sector’s growth and the structural changes in financial systems have heightened stability concerns. although the risks posed by leveraged hedge and money market funds are already widely recognized, opinions about less leveraged “plain-vanilla” investment products are divided. however, even plain-vanilla products may pose financial stability risks through two channels: (1) incentive problems between end investors and portfo-lio managers (which potentially can lead to herding, among other things) and (2) run risk stemming from the presence of liquidity mismatches. the empirical analysis finds evidence of many of these risk-generating mechanisms, although their importance varies across asset markets. without providing a verdict on whether large asset managers should be designated as systemi-cally important, the analysis indicates that a fund’s investment focus is relatively more important than its size when it comes to its contribution to systemic risk.these findings suggest that securities regulators should shift to a more hands-on supervisory model, supported by global standards on supervision and bet-ter data and risk indicators. the roles and adequacy of existing risk-management tools should be reexamined to take into account the asset management industry’s role in systemic risk and the diversity of its products.']\",\n",
       " \"[' international monetary fund | april 2016 ixrisks to global financial stability have increased since the october 2015 global financial stabil-ity report. in advanced economies, the outlook has deteriorated because of heightened uncertainty and set-backs to growth and confidence. disruptions to global asset markets have added to these pressures. declines in oil and commodity prices have kept risks elevated in emerging market economies, while greater uncertainty about china’s growth transition has increased spill-overs to global markets. these developments tightened financial conditions, reduced risk appetite, raised credit risks, and stymied balance sheet repair, undermining financial stability.many market prices dropped dramatically dur-ing the turmoil in

report. bank capital buffers are generally adequate, but will likely be tested by weaker earnings and the downturn in the credit cycle. emerging market economies generally have the tools to boost their resilience and counter the effects of lower commodity prices and the slowdown in growth and capital flows. authorities in emerg-ing market economies should continue to use their buffers and policy space, where available, to smooth adjustment and strengthen sovereign and bank bal-ance sheets. this includes using external buffers, fiscal and monetary policy, and macroprudential and

about its policy goals and strategies consistent with their achievement will be ever more important. given the evident relevance of cor-porate leverage and mutual fund flows in amplifying spillovers of shocks, shaping macroprudential surveil-lance and policies to contain systemic risks arising from these channels will be vital.the resilience of market liquidity should be enhanced. as discussed in previous reports, a comprehensive approach to reducing risks of liquidity runs on mutual funds and strengthening the provision of market liquidity services is needed to avoid the risk of amplify-ing market shocks. the stakes are high. first, rising risks of weakening growth and more instability must be avoided. then, growth must be strengthened and financial stability improved beyond the baseline. an ambitious policy agenda is required, comprising a more balanced and potent policy mix, including stronger financial reforms together with continuing monetary accommodation. increased confidence in policies will help reduce vulnerabilities, remove uncertainties, and touch off a virtuous feedback loop between financial markets and the real economy.

       " \"[' in ternational monetary fund | april 2014 ixthe global financial system is undergoing a number of challenging transitions on the path to greater stability. as the economic recovery in the united states gains foot-ing, u.s. monetary policy has begun to normalize. emerging market economies are transitioning to more sustainable growth in the financial sector, while addressing macroeconomic vulnerabilities amid a less favorable external financial environment. the euro area is strengthening bank capital positions as it moves from fragmentation to a more robust framework for integration. these transitions are far from complete, and stability conditions are far from normal. since october, bouts of financial turbulence have highlighted the substantial adjustment that lies ahead. in advanced economies, financial markets continue to be supported by extraor-dinary monetary accommodation and easy liquidity conditions. they will need to transition away from these supports if they are to create an environment of self-sustaining growth, marked by increased corporate investment and growing employment.for advanced and emerging market economies alike, a successful shift from “liquidity-driven” to “growth-driven” markets requires a number of elements, including a normalization of u.s. monetary policy that avoids financial stability risks; financial rebalancing in emerging market economies amid tighter external financial conditions; further progress in the euro area’s transition from fragmentation to robust integration; and the successful implementation of “abenomics” to deliver sustained growth and stable inflation in japan.the gradual shift to self-sustaining growth is most advanced in the united states, where green shoots are evident from the economic recovery under way, as noted in the april 2014 world economic outlook. the u.s. transition presents several challenges to financial stability. the “search for yield” is becoming increas-ingly extended, with rising leverage in the corporate sector and weakening underwriting standards in some pockets of u.s. credit markets. weaker market liquid-ity and the rapid growth of investment vehicles that are vulnerable to redemption risk could amplify finan-cial or economic shocks. in this transitional period, the reduction in u.s. monetary accommodation could have important spillovers to advanced and emerging market economies alike as portfolios adjust and risks are repriced.amid this shifting global environment, emerging market economies face their own transition challenges, but with substantial differences across economies. private and public balance sheets have become more leveraged since the beginning of the crisis and thus are more sensitive to changes in domestic and external conditions. macroeconomic imbalances have increased in a number of economies in the past few years, while the increased participation of foreign investors in domestic bond markets exposes some economies to an additional source of market volatility and pressure on capital flows. these developments have created a “systemic liquid-ity mismatch,” that is, a disjunction between the potential scale of capital outflows and the capacity of local institutions and market makers (in particular, international banks) to intermediate them. this bottle-neck could magnify the impact of any shocks emanat-ing from other economies and broaden the impact on asset prices, particularly if asset managers seek to hedge exposures by taking positions in more liquid but unrelated markets. the mismatch

distressed markets to keep local bond and money markets working and contain spillovers across economies.in the corporate sector of emerging market econo-mies, this report suggests companies in many cases have sufficient buffers to withstand normal domestic or international shocks, although some vulnerabilities are evident. in a severe and adverse scenario where borrow-ing costs escalate and earnings deteriorate significantly, the debt at risk held by weaker, highly leveraged firms could increase by $740 billion, rising on average to 35 percent of total corporate debt in the sample of firms. in most emerging market economies, reported bank capital buffers and profitability generally remain high and should be sufficient to absorb moderate shocks to nonfinancial companies. nonetheless, in several economies, weak provisioning and lower levels of bank capital could present difficulties in the event of further balance sheet deterioration in the corporate sector. in china, the challenge for policymakers is to man-age an orderly transition toward more market disci-pline in the financial system, including the removal of implicit guarantees. in this process, investors and lenders will have to bear some costs of previous finan-cial excesses, and market prices will need to adjust to more accurately reflect risks. pace is important. if the adjustment is too fast, it risks creating turmoil; if too slow, it will allow vulnerabilities to continue build-ing. other keys to the success of an orderly transition include upgrading the central bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions.in the euro area, policies implemented at both the national and european levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. the restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. thus, european policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. the resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets.in japan, continued monetary accommodation is necessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. the transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. the first stages of abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. more broadly, maintaining the momentum and impetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. geopolitical risks related to ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. chapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of portfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets. the mix of global investors has also changed, and bond funds have become more prominent—especially local currency funds, open-end funds with easy redemption options, and funds investing only opportunistically in emerg-ing market economies. chapter 2 draws on a variety of methods and relatively unexploited data to examine the implications of these changes for the stability of portfolio flows and asset prices in emerging market economies.it finds that changes in the composition of global portfolio investors are likely to make overall portfolio flows more sensitive to global financial shocks. the share of more volatile bond flows has risen, and larger in ternational monetary fund | april 2014 ixthe global financial system is undergoing a number of challenging transitions on the path to greater

bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions.in the euro area, policies implemented at both the national and european levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. the restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. thus, european policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. the resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets.in japan, continued monetary accommodation is necessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. the transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. the first stages of abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. more broadly, maintaining the momentum and impetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. geopolitical risks related to ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. chapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of portfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets. the mix of global investors has also changed, and bond funds have become more prominent—especially local currency funds, open-end funds with easy redemption options, and funds investing only opportunistically in emerg-ing market economies. chapter 2 draws on a variety of methods and relatively unexploited data to examine the implications of these changes for the stability of portfolio flows and asset prices in emerging market economies.it finds that changes in the composition of global portfolio investors are likely to make overall portfolio flows more sensitive to global financial shocks. the share of more volatile bond flows has risen, and larger international monetary fund | april 2014 xiforeign participation in local markets can transmit new instability. the growing activity of institutional investors is potentially more stable, but when fac-ing an extreme shock, they can pull back even more strongly and persistently than other asset managers. while domestic macroeconomic conditions matter, herd behavior among global funds continues, and there are few signs that differentiation along local macroeco-nomic fundamentals during crises has increased over the past 15 years. however, the progress made so far by emerging market economies in promoting a larger local investor base, deepening their banking sectors and capital mar-kets, and improving their institutions has reduced their sensitivity to global financial shocks. a continuation of these efforts can help emerging market economies reap benefits from financial globalization while minimizing its potential costs. chapter 3 looks at how implicit funding subsidies for banks considered too important to fail (titf) have changed over the past few years. government protection for titf banks creates a variety of prob-lems: an uneven playing field, excessive risk taking, and large costs for the public sector. because credi-tors of titf institutions do not bear the full cost of failure, they are willing to provide funding without paying much attention to the banks’ risk profiles, thereby encouraging leverage and risk taking. dur-ing the global financial crisis, governments intervened with large amounts of funds to support distressed banks and safeguard financial stability, leaving little uncertainty about their willingness to bail out failing titf institutions. these developments have further reinforced incentives for banks to become large, and indeed, the concentration of the banking sector in many economies has increased. in response, policy-makers have undertaken ambitious financial reforms to make the financial system safer, including address-ing the titf problem. chapter 3 assesses whether these policy efforts are sufficient to alleviate the titf issue. in particular, it investigates the evolution of the funding cost advan-tages enjoyed by systemically important banks (sibs). the expectation of government support in case of distress represents an implicit public subsidy to those banks. this subsidy rose in all economies during the crisis. although it has declined in most economies since then, it remains elevated, especially in the euro area, likely reflecting different speeds of balance-sheet repair as well as differences in the policy response to the problems in the banking sector. nonetheless, the expected probability that sibs will be bailed out in case of distress has remained high in all regions. although not all measures have been implemented yet, there is still scope for a further strengthening of reforms. these reforms include enhancing capital requirements for sibs or imposing a financial stabil-ity contribution based on the size of the liabilities of banks. progress is also needed in facilitating the supervision and resolution of cross-border financial institutions. in these areas, international coordination is critical to avoid new distortions and negative cross-country spillovers, which may have become even more important because of country-specific policy reforms.']\",\n",

growthcapital markets have become more significant providers of credit since the crisis, shifting the locus of risks to the shadow banking system. the share of credit instruments held in mutual fund portfolios has been growing, doubling since 2007, and now amounts to 27 percent of global high-yield debt. at the same time, the fund management industry has become more con-centrated. the top 10 global asset management firms now account for more than $19 trillion in assets under management. the combination of asset concentration, extended portfolio positions and valuations, flight-prone investors, and vulnerable liquidity structures have increased the sensitivity of key credit markets, increasing market and liquidity risks. emerging markets are more vulnerable to shocks from advanced economies, as they now absorb a much larger share of the outward portfolio investment from advanced economies. a consequence of these stronger links is the increased synchronization of asset price movements and volatilities.these structural changes in credit markets, together with the expected normalization of monetary policy in the united states, have raised market and liquidity risks in ways that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed. the increased sensitivity of credit markets could make the exit process more volatile, potentially undermining the ability of the financial system to support the recovery.to illustrate these potential risks to credit markets, this report examines the impact of a rapid market adjustment that causes term premiums in bond markets to revert to historic norms (increasing by 100 basis points) and credit risk premiums to normalize (a repricing of credit risks by 100 basis points). such a shock could reduce the market value of global bond portfolios by more than 8 percent, or in excess of $3.8 trillion. if losses on this scale were to materialize over a short time horizon, the ensuing portfolio adjustments and market turmoil could trigger significant disruption in global markets. managing risks from an ongoing overhaul in bank business models to better support economic risk takingthe policy challenge is to remove impediments to economic risk taking and strengthen the transmission of credit to the real economy. banks have come a long way since the global financial crisis. adjustment has proceeded at different stages, with the first stage focus-ing on emergency stabilization measures. in the second phase, banks have strived to adapt to new business and regulatory realities. since the start of the crisis, banks hold significantly more capital and have accelerated balance sheet repair. but progress has been uneven across banks and many institutions need to do more to achieve a sustainable business model. today, low profitability raises concerns about some banks’ ability to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. reflecting the size and breadth of the challenge, 80 percent of assets of the largest institu-tions have a return on equity that does not cover the cost of capital required by shareholders. these banks are entering a third phase, in which they will need a more fundamental overhaul of their business models. this will include a combination of repricing existing business lines, reallocating capital across activities, restructuring, or retrenching altogether. based on a sample of 300 advanced economy banks, this report finds that many banks have the potential capacity to supply credit, although there is a group of institutions, mostly from the euro area, that would require a high level of repricing to generate sustainable profits and rebuild capital buffers. such a repricing may not be feasible, especially if done on a stand-alone basis and not followed by other market participants. this could limit these banks’ capacity to meet credit demand, particularly in those countries that are in greatest need of a recovery in credit, and create head-winds for the economic recovery. strengthening the transmission of credit means, in part, encouraging the prompt and orderly exit of nonviable banks. this would help relieve competi-tive pressures in a context of excess capacity and allow viable banks to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. regulators can further assist that process by encouraging banks to move away from old practices of cross-subsidizing products and adopt more flexible and transparent business models with product pricing that reflects risks and regulatory requirements. the credit transmission mechanism will also be aided, particularly in europe, by greater market-based access to credit, including through safe securitization. this will take time, particularly for financial systems that have traditionally been reliant on bank lending. removing impediments to nonbank participation in credit origination will require solid regulatory frame-works for nonbanks. as discussed

xithat could develop as the financial system evolves in the coming years—with some activities moving from banks to nonbanks—and ensure that these risks are effectively mitigated and managed.improving the balance between economic and financial risk taking with policies to safeguard financial stabilitymonetary policy should remain committed to achiev-ing the central banks’ mandate of price stability and—where relevant—output stability, while macro-prudential policies should be the first line of defense against financial excesses that can threaten stability. improving the monetary policy trade-off and contain-ing the financial stability risks identified in this report require the effective deployment of a suite of micro- and macroprudential policy tools. this will reduce the need to tighten interest rates earlier than warranted by the needs of the economy. it will also make systemic institutions more resilient, help contain procyclical asset price and credit dynamics, and cushion the conse-quences of liquidity squeezes when volatility returns. macroprudential measures depend on three steps. first, policymakers must have the data necessary to monitor the build-up of financial stability risks. second, they must prepare to ensure they have the statutory authority and analytical capacity to use the macroprudential policy tools that may be needed. this is particularly important in the nonbanking sec-tor, where the regulatory framework is not yet fully in place and needs to be extended to tackle emerg-ing risks. third, policymakers must have an explicit mandate to act when needed and, equally important, the courage to act, even when measures are highly unpopular. effective and balanced communication of the measures undertaken will also be needed.a central concern is the market liquidity risk arising from the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when meeting redemptions in times of stress. the policy remedy should seek to address this mismatch, by removing incentives of asset owners to run—by aligning redemption terms of funds with the underlying liquidity in the assets invested—enhanc-ing the accuracy of net asset values, increasing liquid-ity cash buffers in mutual funds, and improving the liquidity and transparency of secondary markets, spe-cifically for longer-term debt markets. redemption fees that benefit remaining shareholders are one option; however, the calibration of such a fee is challenging and to the extent possible, should not be time varying, as this could encourage asset flight. similarly, gates to limit redemptions appear to solve some incentive prob-lems, but may simply accelerate redemptions ahead of potential imposition and lead to contagion.policymakers should also explore contingency measures in cases where illiquidity in markets has the potential for contagion. for advanced economies, bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements could reduce excess volatility by ensuring access to foreign currency funding in times of stress. for emerging markets, in the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning. possible actions include using cash balances, lowering the supply of long-term debt, and conducting switching auctions to temporarily reduce supply on the long end of yield curves. in addition to bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements to access foreign currency funding in times of stress, mul-tilateral resources such as imf facilities could provide additional buffers. keeping emerging market econo-mies resilient calls for an increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities, including weak bank provisioning practices and low loss-absorbing bank buffers in some countries, as discussed in previous reports.finally, policymakers need to pursue a vigorous agenda of structural reforms in product and labor markets to increase the return on investment and make the recovery more sustainable. growth, risks, and regulatory responses to shadow banking around the worldchapter 2 shows that in advanced economies, more narrowly defined shadow banking measures indicate stagnation, while broader measures (which include investment funds) generally point to continued growth since the global financial crisis. in emerging market economies, the growth of shadow banking continues to outpace that of the traditional banking system.shadow banking varies greatly across and within countries, but empirical results show that some of the key drivers behind its growth are common to all its forms: a tightening of banking regulation, ample liquidity conditions, and demand by institutional investors. hence, the current financial environment in advanced economies remains conducive to further growth in shadow banking, including the migration of corporate lending from traditional banking to the international monetary fund |

market-based access to credit, including through safe securitization. this will take time, particularly for financial systems that have traditionally been reliant on bank lending. removing impediments to nonbank participation in credit origination will require solid regulatory frame-works for nonbanks. as discussed further in chapter 2, policymakers need to closely monitor the risks executive su mm ary international monetary fund | october 2014 xithat could develop as the financial system evolves in the coming years—with some activities moving from banks to nonbanks—and ensure that these risks are effectively mitigated and managed.improving the balance between economic and financial risk taking with policies to safeguard financial stabilitymonetary policy should remain committed to achiev-ing the central banks’ mandate of price stability and—where relevant—output stability, while macro-prudential policies should be the first line of defense against financial excesses that can threaten stability. improving the monetary policy trade-off and contain-ing the financial stability risks identified in this report require the effective deployment of a suite of micro- and macroprudential policy tools. this will reduce the need to tighten interest rates earlier than warranted by the needs of the economy. it will also make systemic institutions more resilient, help contain procyclical asset price and credit dynamics, and cushion the conse-quences of liquidity squeezes when volatility returns. macroprudential measures depend on three steps. first, policymakers must have the data necessary to monitor the build-up of financial stability risks. second, they must prepare to ensure they have the statutory authority and analytical capacity to use the macroprudential policy tools that may be needed. this is particularly important in the nonbanking sec-tor, where the regulatory framework is not yet fully in place and needs to be extended to tackle emerg-ing risks. third, policymakers must have an explicit mandate to act when needed and, equally important, the courage to act, even when measures are highly unpopular. effective and balanced communication of the measures undertaken will also be needed.a central concern is the market liquidity risk arising from the mismatch between the liquidity promised to mutual fund owners in good times and the cost of illiquidity when meeting redemptions in times of stress. the policy remedy should seek to address this mismatch, by removing incentives of asset owners to run—by aligning redemption terms of funds with the underlying liquidity in the assets invested—enhanc-ing the accuracy of net asset values, increasing liquid-ity cash buffers in mutual funds, and improving the liquidity and transparency of secondary markets, spe-cifically for longer-term debt markets. redemption fees that benefit remaining shareholders are one option; however, the calibration of such a fee is challenging and to the extent possible, should not be time varying, as this could encourage asset flight. similarly, gates to limit redemptions appear to solve some incentive prob-lems, but may simply accelerate redemptions ahead of potential imposition and lead to contagion.policymakers should also explore contingency measures in cases where illiquidity in markets has the potential for contagion. for advanced economies, bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements could reduce excess volatility by ensuring access to foreign currency funding in times of stress. for emerging markets, in the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning. possible actions include using cash balances, lowering the supply of long-term debt, and conducting switching auctions to temporarily reduce supply on the long end of yield curves. in addition to bilateral and multilateral swap line arrangements to access foreign currency funding in times of stress, mul-tilateral resources such as imf facilities could provide additional buffers. keeping emerging market econo-mies resilient calls for an increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities, including weak bank provisioning practices and low loss-absorbing bank buffers in some countries, as discussed in previous reports.finally, policymakers need to pursue a vigorous agenda of structural reforms in product and labor markets to increase the return on investment and make the recovery more sustainable. growth, risks, and regulatory responses to shadow banking around the worldchapter 2 shows that in advanced economies, more narrowly defined shadow banking measures indicate stagnation, while broader measures (which include investment funds) generally point to continued growth since the global financial crisis. in emerging market economies, the growth of shadow banking continues to outpace that of the traditional banking system.shadow banking varies greatly across and within countries, but empirical results show that some of the key drivers behind its growth are common to all its forms: a tightening of banking regulation, ample liquidity conditions, and demand by institutional investors. hence, the current financial environment in advanced economies remains conducive to further growth in shadow banking, including the migration of corporate lending from traditional banking to the xii international monetary fund | october 2014global financial stability report: risk taking, liquidity , and shadow banking—curbing excess while promoting growthnonbank sector. data limitations prevent a compre-hensive assessment, but shadow banking in the united states seems to pose a greater risk to domestic financial stability than shadow banking in the euro area and the united kingdom. policymakers need a more encompassing approach to regulation and supervision that focuses on both shadow banking activities and entities and places a greater emphasis on systemic risk. a critical element of that approach is better data on shadow banking.risk taking, governance, and compensation in bankschapter 3 empirically investigates the relation of risk taking in banks to banks’ ownership structure, gover-nance, and executive pay incentives. the results show that banks with board members who are independent from bank management tend to take less risk, as do banks whose boards have a risk committee and those that have large institutional ownership. the level of executive compensation in banks is not consistently related to risk taking, but more long-term incentive pay is associated with less risk. as expected, periods of severe financial stress alter some of these effects, as incentives change when a bank gets closer to default. in particular, when banks are weak, evidence indicates that shareholders (who are protected by limited liability) have an incentive to make risky bets at the expense of creditors—who expect to be bailed out—and society at large.these results suggest policy measures, including some that have been part of the policy debate but had not previously been empirically validated. these mea-sures include making compensation of bank executives more appropriately risk sensitive (including to the risk exposure of bank creditors), deferring some compensa-tion, and providing for clawbacks. bank boards should be more independent from management and establish risk committees. in addition, supervisors should ensure that board oversight of risk taking in banks is effective. the potential merits (and possible unintentional con-sequences) of including representation for debt holders on bank boards should be studied. finally, transpar-ency is critical to accountability and the effectiveness of market discipline.']\",\n",

the usefulness of markets for sovereign credit default swaps (scds) intensi-fied with the most recent bout of sovereign stress in the euro area. chapter 2 takes a closer look at whether scds markets are good market indicators of sovereign credit risk and whether they provide valuable protection to hedgers; or whether they are prone to speculative excesses and lead to higher sovereign funding costs and financial instability. the chapter finds that many of the negative perceptions are unfounded. the markets for both scds and sovereign bonds are similar in their ability to reflect economic fundamentals and market factors. scds markets tend to convey new information more rapidly than do the markets for government bonds during periods of stress, although not during other times; but scds markets do not appear to be more prone to high volatility than other financial mar-kets. while overshooting was detected in some euro area scds markets during the latest bout of stress, there is little evidence that “excessive” increases in a country’s scds spreads generally lead to higher sov-ereign funding costs. the question of whether scds markets are more likely to be contagious than other markets is difficult to answer because sovereigns and financial institutions are now more interconnected, and hence the risks embedded in scds cannot be readily isolated from the risk of the financial system. the chapter’s results do not support the need for a ban on “naked” scds protection buying, which went into effect in the european union in novem-ber 2012. the policy initiatives underlying the over-the-counter derivatives reforms—mandating better disclosure, encouraging central clearing, and requir-ing the posting of appropriate collateral—should help to allay concerns about spillovers and contagion that may arise in these derivatives markets. chapter 3: do central bank policies since the crisis carry risks to financial s tability?chapter 3 returns to the issue of

markets during the latest bout of stress, there is little evidence that “excessive” increases in a country’s scds spreads generally lead to higher sov-ereign funding costs. the question of whether scds markets are more likely to be contagious than other markets is difficult to answer because sovereigns and financial institutions are now more interconnected, and hence the risks embedded in scds cannot be readily isolated from the risk of the financial system. the chapter’s results do not support the need for a ban on “naked” scds protection buying, which went into effect in the european union in novem-ber 2012. the policy initiatives underlying the over-the-counter derivatives reforms—mandating better disclosure, encouraging central clearing, and requir-ing the posting of appropriate collateral—should help to allay concerns about spillovers and contagion that may arise in these derivatives markets. chapter 3: do central bank policies since the crisis carry risks to financial s tability?chapter 3 returns to the issue of unconventional monetary policy and its potential side effects with further in-depth analysis. the chapter investigates the policies as pursued by four central banks (the xiv international monetary fund | april 2013federal reserve, bank of england, european central bank, and bank of japan), which include a pro-longed period of low real policy interest rates and a host of unconventional measures including asset purchases. the policies, termed “mp-plus” in the chapter, appear to have lessened banking sector vulnerabilities and contributed to financial stability in the short term—in line with the intentions of the central banks. so far, central bank intervention in specific asset markets has not adversely affected market liquidity. mp-plus policies have improved some indicators of bank soundness, although the evi-dence suggests some reluctance by banks to clean up their balance sheets. although potential risks raised by mp-plus in the banking system so far appear relatively benign, policymakers should be alert to the possibility that risks may be shifting to other parts of the financial system—shadow banks, pension funds, and insurance companies—due in part to increasing regulatory pressures on banks. policymakers should use targeted micro- and macroprudential policies to mitigate emerging pockets of vulnerability (identi-fied in chapter 1) that are likely to increase the longer that mp-plus policies are in use. implement-ing macroprudential policies in a measured manner, as needed, would allow central banks to continue to use mp-plus to support price stability and growth while protecting financial stability.']\",\n",

that could raise domestic xii international monetary fund | october 2012financial stability risks. local bond markets have continued to attract inflows even as the euro area crisis intensified. overall, many countries in central and eastern europe are the most vulnerable because of their direct exposures to the euro area and certain similarities they bear to countries in the euro area periphery. asia and latin america generally appear more resilient, but several key regional economies are prone to the risks associated with being in the late phase of a credit cycle that has featured an extended period of rising property prices and debt. mean-while, the scope to provide fresh policy stimulus is somewhat constrained in several economies, which underscores the need to deftly manage country-specific challenges. the crisis has spurred a host of regulatory reforms to make the financial system safer. chap-ter 3 contains an interim report on whether these reforms are moving the financial sector in the right direction against a benchmark set of desirable features—financial institutions and markets that are more transparent, less complex, and less leveraged. the analysis suggests that, although there has been some progress over the past five years, financial sys-tems have not come much closer to those desirable features. they are still overly complex, with strong domestic interbank linkages, and concentrated, with the too-important-to-fail issues unresolved. while there has not yet been any serious setback to financial globalization, in the absence of appropriate policies economies are still susceptible to harmful cross-border spillovers. progress has been limited partly because many regulatory reforms are still in the early stages of implementation and partly because crisis intervention measures are still in use by a number of economies, delaying the “reboot-ing” of the financial system onto a safer path. although the reforms currently under way are likely to produce a safer banking system over time, the chapter points to some areas that still require atten-tion: (1)\\\\xa0a global discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on business activities to address the too-important-to-fail issue, (2) more attention to segments of the nonbank system that may be posing systemic risks, and (3) further progress on recovery and resolution plans for large institutions, especially those that operate across borders. chapter 4 tackles the fundamental question of whether certain aspects of financial structure enhance economic outcomes. are the forces cur-rently changing financial structures, including regulatory reforms, likely to result in structures that will support higher, less volatile growth and a more stable financial system? the chapter finds that some structural features are indeed associated with better outcomes and others with less growth and more volatility. in particular, financial buffers (both for capital and liquidity) tend to be associated with better economic performance, whereas some types of nontraditional bank intermediation are linked to less favorable results. the analysis also indicates that certain positive characteristics may sometimes turn negative. for instance, some measures of cross-border connections are beneficial most of the time, but if not managed properly they can act as conduits to transmit destabilizing shocks during a crisis. overall, the analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, since it is constrained by important gaps in data and a relatively short sample period that included the global financial crisis. as a result, the policy conclusions can only be viewed as tenta-tive. nonetheless, two of those that emerge are that (1)\\\\xa0financial buffers made up of high-quality capital and truly liquid assets generally help economic per-formance; and (2) banks’ global interconnectivity needs to be managed well so as to reap the benefits of cross-border activities, while limiting adverse spillovers during a crisis. both chapters 3 and 4 also stress that the success of steps aimed at producing a safer financial system hinges on effective implementation and strong supervision. without those elements, regulatory reform may fail to secure greater financial stability.']\",\n",

further efforts are needed to assess the way in which market developments and regula-tory initiatives affecting dealer-bank business models may influence the cost and provision of market liquidity. at a minimum, increased surveillance of and vigilance over the effects of trading liquidity pressures will be needed as financial markets move to a regime with higher interest rates and volatility. if

regions and potentially derail the smooth transition to greater stability.chapter 2 looks at efforts by policymakers to revive weak credit growth, which has been seen by many as a primary reason behind the slow economic recovery. the chapter catalogues the policies implemented by vari-ous countries and offers a framework for assessing their effectiveness. it argues that policies are most effective if they target the constraints that underlie the weakness in credit. using several analytical tools, the chapter finds that the constraints in credit markets differ by country and evolve over time, requiring a careful country-by-country assessment. better data on new lending would also help identify constraints. in many cases, demand- and supply-oriented policies are complementary, but their relative magnitude and sequencing can be impor-tant. moreover, policymakers should be cognizant of the fiscal costs and implications for financial stability of credit-supporting policies. the main risks center on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of under-writing standards and the risk of “evergreening” existing loans. mitigation of these risks may not be necessary or appropriate while the economic recovery is still weak because it could run counter to the objectives of the credit policies (which are often designed to increase risk taking); still, policymakers will need to continually weigh the near-term benefits against the longer-run costs of policies aimed at boosting credit.chapter 3 explores how bank funding structures affect financial stability and whether regulatory reform initiatives are likely to make them more stable, diversi-fied, and resilient. the chapter finds that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt—especially short-term wholesale funding that contributed to the global financial crisis—and use deposits as their primary funding source. various reforms are rightly promoting many of these desirable attributes, but there could be potential trade-offs among them. on the one hand, there are pressures to use more secured fund-ing—which increases asset encumbrance—as well as deposits, to reduce banks’ vulnerability to turbulence in wholesale funding markets. on the other hand, bail-in power and depositor preference give better pro-tection to taxpayers and depositors at the expense of unsecured wholesale debt holders. a numerical analysis illustrates the impact on the cost of unsecured debt as the proportion of newly protected creditors rises. under current conditions and depositor protections (and especially for well-capitalized banks) the increase would be modest; however, if depositor protections were to be expanded substantially, the impact could be quite large. careful implementation of the reforms can moderate tensions: basel iii and over-the-counter derivative reforms should be implemented as planned, but policymakers should monitor the increased demand for collateral and ensure that enough unen-cumbered assets are available to permit the meaningful bail-in of unsecured senior creditors. international monetary fund | october 2013 xithe global financial system is undergoing a series of transitions along the path toward greater financial stability. the united states may soon move to less accommodative mon-etary policies and higher long-term interest rates as its recovery gains ground. after a prolonged period of strong portfolio inflows, emerging markets are facing a transition to more volatile external conditions and higher risk premiums. some need to address financial and macroeconomic vulnerabilities and bolster resil-ience, as they shift to a regime in which financial sector growth is more balanced and sustainable. japan is mov-ing toward the new “abenomics” policy regime marked by more vigorous monetary easing, coupled with fiscal and structural reforms. the euro area is moving toward a more robust and safer financial sector, including a stronger monetary union with a common framework for risk mitigation, while strengthening financial systems and reducing excessive debt levels. finally, the global banking system is phasing in stronger regulatory standards. chapter 1 examines the challenges and risks of each of these transitions.the primary challenge resulting from these changes relates to managing the side effects and eventual withdrawal of accommodative monetary policy in the united states. such a transition, including the benefits of a strong u.s. economy, should help limit financial stability risks associated with an extended period of low interest rates. yet managing a smooth transition could prove challenging, as investors adjust portfolios for a new regime with higher interest rates and greater volatility. the analysis in chapter 1 highlights the risk that long-term interest rates could rise more sharply than currently anticipated. structural reductions in market liquidity and leveraged positions in short-term funding markets and the shadow banking system (for instance, in the mortgage real estate investment trust sector) could amplify these rate increases and spill over to global markets.financial stability challenges are also prevalent in many emerging market economies. bond markets are now more sensitive to changes in accommoda-tive monetary policies in advanced economies because foreign investors have crowded into local markets and may withdraw. emerging market fundamentals have weakened in recent years, after a protracted interval of credit expansion and rising corporate leverage. manag-ing the risks of the transition to a more balanced and sustainable financial sector, while maintaining robust growth and financial stability, will be a key undertak-ing confronting policymakers.as central banks elsewhere consider strategies for eventual exit from unconventional monetary poli-cies, japan is scaling up monetary stimulus under the abenomics framework, aiming to pull the economy out of its deflationary rut. successful implementation of a complete policy package that features fiscal and structural reforms would reinforce domestic financial stability, while likely boosting capital outflows. but sub-stantial risks to financial stability could accompany the program if planned fiscal and structural reforms are not fully implemented. failure to enact these reforms could lead to a return of deflation and increased bank holdings of government debt, further increasing the already-high sovereign-bank nexus. in a more disorderly scenario, with higher inflation and elevated risk premiums, the risks to both domestic and global financial stability could be greater still, including rapid rises in bond yields and volatility, and sharp increases in outflows.in the euro area, reforms implemented at the national level and important steps taken toward improving the architecture of the monetary union have helped reduce funding pressures on banks and sovereigns. however, in the stressed economies of italy, portugal, and spain, heavy corporate sector debt loads and financial fragmentation remain challenging. even if financial fragmentation is reversed over the medium term, this report estimates that a persistent debt over-hang would remain, amounting to almost one-fifth of the combined corporate debt of italy, portugal, and spain. assuming no further improvement in economic and financial conditions which would correspond to a more adverse outcome than the cyclical improvement built into the october 2013 world economic outlook baseline scenario, some banks in these economies might need to further increase provisioning to address global financial stability report: transition challenges to stabilityxii international monetary fund | october 2013the potential deterioration in asset quality of corporate loan books. this could absorb a large portion of future bank profits. recent efforts to assess asset quality and boost provisions and capital have helped to increase the loss-absorption capacity of banks, but further efforts to cleanse bank balance sheets and to move to full banking union are vital. these steps should be comple-mented by a comprehensive assessment and strategy to address the debt overhang in nonfinancial companies.a number of policy actions can help promote an orderly move toward greater financial stability: •\\\\tstronger growth in the united states is setting the stage for monetary normalization. achieving a smooth transition requires policies that man-age the effects of increased volatility and portfolio adjustments, while addressing structural liquidity weaknesses and systemic vulnerabilities. a clear and well-timed communication strategy by central bank officials is critical. compared with previous tighten-ing cycles, the authorities have a bigger toolkit at their disposal. yet in the event of adverse shocks, contin-gency backstops may be needed to address the risk of fire sales in some market segments and to manage orderly unwinding or liquidation. increased oversight would help reduce related risks of excessive leverage in the shadow banking system and, in particular, in the larger mortgage real estate investment trusts. •\\\\tfor emerging market economies, the principal trans-mission channel of external pressures is more likely to be via liquidity strains in bond and foreign exchange markets, rather than through bank funding chan-nels. in addition, the response of foreign investors to changing expectations for u.s. monetary policy will continue to affect local markets. in the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning, using their policy buffers wisely. keeping emerging market economies resilient requires increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities as relative growth prospects moderate, u.s. nominal rates rise, and capital flows recede. policymakers should carefully monitor and contain the rapid growth of corporate leverage. local bank regulators need to guard against foreign currency funding mismatches affecting bank balance sheets, including through foreign currency borrowing by companies. in addition, establishing sufficient buf-fers and addressing macroeconomic imbalances will likely prove to be worthwhile steps for cushioning against increased volatility and risk premiums. •\\\\tcontaining the risks to china’s financial system is as important as it is challenging. broad credit growth needs to be reined in to contain financial stability risks and promote the rebalancing of china’s econ-omy away from credit-fueled capital and property investment. it is important that prudential oversight of shadow banking activity be tightened, that incen-tives for regulatory arbitrage be removed through continued financial liberalization (for example, of deposit rates), and that the widespread belief in implicit guarantees and bailouts of risky corporate loans and saving products be counteracted. unless credit losses are taken by lenders and savers, the state faces large and unpredictable fiscal costs.•\\\\tjapan’s bold policies need to be completed, with the authorities following through on fiscal and structural policy commitments, to avoid downside risks. these policies are needed to contain a potential sharp rise in government bond risk premiums if sovereign debt dynamics do not improve. to help mitigate stability risks, market structures also need to be made more resilient (such as through the modification of circuit breakers in derivatives markets) and the risk profile of regional banks addressed.•\\\\tin the euro area, further progress in reducing debt overhangs and bolstering bank balance sheets needs to go hand in hand with a strengthened euro area financial architecture and the completion of the banking union agenda. investors’ faith in euro area bank balance sheets needs to be fully restored and credit flows to viable enterprises strengthened: a first step, as planned, is to conduct a thorough, realistic, and transparent balance sheet assessment. credible capital backstops to meet any identified shortfalls need to be put in place and communicated in advance of the publication of results from the exercise. the corporate debt overhang should be addressed using a more comprehensive approach, including corporate debt cleanups, improvements to corporate bankruptcy frameworks, and active facilitation of nonbank sources of credit. further monetary support by the european central bank and credit support to viable firms by the european investment bank are crucial to providing time for the repair of private balance sheets.•\\\\tglobal bank capitalization remains diverse, because institutions are at different stages of balance sheet repair and operate in different economic and regula-tory environments. the key tasks are to improve executive su mm ary international monetary fund | october 2013 xiiithe credibility, transparency, and strength of balance sheets, while avoiding undue pressures on banks from uncoordinated national regulatory initiatives and uncertainty. further efforts are needed to assess the way in which market developments and regula-tory initiatives affecting dealer-bank business models may influence the cost and provision of market liquidity. at a minimum, increased surveillance of and vigilance over the effects of trading liquidity pressures will be needed as financial markets move to a regime with higher interest rates and volatility. if these policy challenges are properly managed, and if reforms are implemented as promised, the transition toward greater financial stability should prove smooth and provide a more robust platform for financial sector activity and economic growth. but a failure to imple-ment the reforms necessary to address the many policy challenges highlighted above could trigger profound spillovers across regions and potentially derail the smooth transition to greater stability.chapter 2 looks at efforts by policymakers to revive weak credit growth, which has been seen by many as a primary reason behind the slow economic recovery. the chapter catalogues the policies implemented by vari-ous countries and offers a framework for assessing their effectiveness. it argues that policies are most effective if they target the constraints that underlie the weakness in credit. using several analytical tools, the chapter finds that the constraints in credit markets differ by country and evolve over time, requiring a careful country-by-country assessment. better data on new lending would also help identify constraints. in many cases, demand- and supply-oriented policies are complementary, but their relative magnitude and sequencing can be impor-tant. moreover, policymakers should be cognizant of the fiscal costs and implications for financial stability of credit-supporting policies. the main risks center on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of under-writing standards and the risk of “evergreening” existing loans. mitigation of these risks may not be necessary or appropriate while the economic recovery is still weak because it could run counter to the objectives of the credit policies (which are often designed to increase risk taking); still, policymakers will need to continually weigh the near-term benefits against the longer-run costs of policies aimed at boosting credit.chapter 3 explores how bank funding structures affect financial stability and whether regulatory reform initiatives are likely to make them more stable, diversi-fied, and resilient. the chapter finds that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt—especially short-term wholesale funding that contributed to the global financial crisis—and use deposits as their primary funding source. various reforms are rightly promoting many of these desirable attributes, but there could be potential trade-offs among them. on the one hand, there are pressures to use more secured fund-ing—which increases asset encumbrance—as well as deposits, to reduce banks’ vulnerability to turbulence in wholesale funding markets. on the other hand, bail-in power and depositor preference give better pro-tection to taxpayers and depositors at the expense of unsecured wholesale debt holders. a numerical analysis illustrates the impact on the cost of unsecured debt as the proportion of newly protected creditors rises. under current conditions and depositor protections (and especially for well-capitalized banks) the increase would be modest; however, if depositor protections were to be expanded substantially, the impact could be quite large. careful implementation of the reforms can moderate tensions: basel iii and over-the-counter derivative reforms should be implemented as planned, but policymakers should monitor the increased demand for collateral and ensure that enough unen-cumbered assets are available to permit the meaningful bail-in of unsecured senior creditors.']\",\n",

united states, financial stability has improved, but pockets of vulnerability remain in the banking system. although banks have been able to raise a substantial amount of capital, and expected demands appear manageable, some raising of additional capital may be needed to reverse recent deleveraging trends and possibly to comply with u.s. regulatory reforms. weakness in the real estate sector constitutes an additional challenge in the united states. to a large extent, the apparently modest capital needs of u.s. banks reflect the large scale of government-sponsored enterprises and other government interventions without which those needs would have been substantially higher. this highlights the extent to which risk has been transferred from private to public balance sheets, as well as the need to address the burden placed on public institutions. in japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely. so far, the stable domestic savings base and healthy current account surplus reduce the need to attract external funding sources. over time, the factors presently supporting the japanese bond market—high private savings, home bias, and the lack of alternatives to yen-denominated assets—are expected to erode as the population ages and the workforce declines. overall, emerging markets have proven very resilient to sovereign and banking strains in advanced economies, and most have continued to enjoy access to international capital markets. cross-border spillover effects were mostly confined to regions with significant economic and financial links to the euro area. with the current slowdown in growth in advanced countries, emerging markets, in general, have become increasingly attractive to investors because of their relatively sound fundamentals and stronger growth potential. this shift in global asset allocation is likely to increase as long as this relative difference persists. however, a potential buildup of macro-financial risks stemming from strong capital inflows—including from excess demand in local markets and possible increased volatility—remains a concern for countries on the receiving end of this ongoing asset

proposed financial reform agenda remains unfinished. international rule-making bodies have made progress to identify the most egregious failings of the global finan-cial system in the run-up to the crisis, but their member countries have yet to agree on many of the details of the reforms. dealing with too-important-to-fail entities, strengthening supervisory incentives and resources, and devel-oping the macro-prudential framework are still under discussion. further progress will require a willingness to sup-press domestic interests in favor of a more stable and better functioning global financial system. the sooner reforms can be clarified, the sooner financial institutions can formulate their strategic priorities and business models. in the absence of such progress, regulatory inadequacies will continue for some time, increasing the chances of renewed financial instability.as part of these ongoing efforts, we welcome the recent proposals of the bcbs, which represent a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of capital in comparison with the pre-crisis situation. in particular, com-mon equity will represent a higher proportion of capital and thus allow for greater loss absorption. also, the amount of intangible and qualified assets that can be included in capital will be limited (to 15 percent). these include deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in common shares of financial institutions, and other intangible assets. phase-in arrangements have been developed to allow banks to move to these higher standards mainly through retention of earnings. as the global financial system stabilizes and the world economic recovery is firmly entrenched, phasing out intangibles completely and scaling back the transition period should be considered. this will raise banking sector resilience to absorb any future shocks that may lie ahead. furthermore, it is essential to make progress with the overall reform agenda. putting in place sound micro-prudential regulation is not suffi-cient. appropriate regulation needs to be developed with a macro-prudential approach to dampen procyclicality and to limit the systemic effects of financial institutions, some of which are not banks.overall, policymakers cannot relax their efforts to reduce refinancing risks, strengthen balance sheets, and reform regulatory frameworks. as apparent on several occasions over the past three years, conditions in the global financial system now have the potential of jumping from benign to crisis mode very rapidly. against this backdrop, policy-makers should not squander opportunities to strengthen and recapitalize banking systems, address too-important-to-fail entities, reduce contingent liabilities, and place sovereigns on a credible fiscal path. with the situation still fragile, some of the public support that has been given to banks in recent years will have to be continued. planned exit strategies from unconventional monetary and financial policies may need to be delayed until the situation is more robust. at the same time, it is important to ensure that the need for extraordinary support is temporary, as it is no substitute for repairing and reforming financial sectors, and realigning their incentives to build stronger bal-ance sheets and reduce excessive risk taking. for emerging markets, the policy challenges are different, with most of the financial system risks on the upside. many will need to cope with the effects of relative success, where maintaining stability will depend on their abil-ity to deal with surges in portfolio inflows. t raditional macroeconomic policies may need to be supplemented in some cases by macro-prudential measures as they may not be fully adequate to meet the macro-financial challenges arising from particular domestic circumstances, such as inflation pressures or asset bubbles. policies to address high and volatile capital flows are well known (see chapter 4 of the april 2010 gfsr and imf staff position note 10/04). moreover, emerging markets should continue to pursue policies aimed at fostering the development of local financial systems, so that they have the capacity to absorb and safely and efficiently intermediate higher volumes of capital flows. chapter 2: systemic liquidity riska defining characteristic of the crisis was the depth and duration of the systemic liquidity disruption to key fund-ing markets—that is, the simultaneous and protracted inability of financial institutions to roll over or obtain new short-term

demand. nevertheless, sover-eign balance sheets are highly vulnerable to growth shocks, making debt sustainability less certain. in this context, policymakers must tackle the following key reforms in order to ensure a viable global financial system and safeguard the recovery: (1) deal with the legacy problems in the banking sector, including, where necessary, recapitalization; (2) strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets; and (3) continue to clarify and specify regulatory reform, building on the substantial improve-ments proposed by the basel committee on banking supervision (bcbs).x international monetary fund | october 2010markets remain open, continuing forceful policy measures are needed to remain firmly on track toward building financial system resilience. in the united states, financial stability has improved, but pockets of vulnerability remain in the banking system. although banks have been able to raise a substantial amount of capital, and expected demands appear manageable, some raising of additional capital may be needed to reverse recent deleveraging trends and possibly to comply with u.s. regulatory reforms. weakness in the real estate sector constitutes an additional challenge in the united states. to a large extent, the apparently modest capital needs of u.s. banks reflect the large scale of government-sponsored enterprises and other government interventions without which those needs would have been substantially higher. this highlights the extent to which risk has been transferred from private to public balance sheets, as well as the need to address the burden placed on public institutions. in japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely. so far, the stable domestic savings base and healthy current account surplus reduce the need to attract external funding sources. over time, the factors presently supporting the japanese bond market—high private savings, home bias, and the lack of alternatives to yen-denominated assets—are expected to erode as the population ages and the workforce declines. overall, emerging markets have proven very resilient to sovereign and banking strains in advanced economies, and most have continued to enjoy access to international capital markets. cross-border spillover effects were mostly confined to regions with significant economic and financial links to the euro area. with the current slowdown in growth in advanced countries, emerging markets, in general, have become increasingly attractive to investors because of their relatively sound fundamentals and stronger growth potential. this shift in global asset allocation is likely to increase as long as this relative difference persists. however, a potential buildup of macro-financial risks stemming from strong capital inflows—including from excess demand in local markets and possible increased volatility—remains a concern for countries on the receiving end of this ongoing asset reallocation. policies to address risks policymakers in many advanced countries will need to confront the interactions created by slow growth, rising sovereign indebtedness, and still-fragile financial institutions. in addition, the foundations underpinning the new financial regulatory regime need to be put into place.address legacy problems in the banking system. confidence in the financial sector has not been fully restored. on the bright side, bank regulatory capital ratios have improved and global writedowns and loan provisions have declined. our estimate of crisis-related bank writedowns between 2007 and 2010 has fallen slightly from $2.3\\\\xa0tril-lion in the april 2010 gfsr to $2.2 trillion now, driven mainly by a fall in securities losses. in addition, banks have made further progress in recognizing those writedowns, with more than three-quarters of them already reported, leaving a residual amount of approximately $550 billion. there has been less progress, though, in deal-ing with the imminent bank funding pressures: nearly $4 trillion of bank debt will need to be rolled over in the next 24\\\\xa0months. as a consequence, exits from extraordinary financial system support, including the removal of government guarantees of bank debt, will have to be carefully sequenced and planned. resolving and/or restructur-ing weaker financial institutions—through closure, recapitalization, or merger—remains a priority so that funding markets can return to normal and the industry to better health. national and supranational backstops should be available to provide support where needed.strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets. in the short term, adequate supranational support should be available to sovereign balance sheets in those countries facing immediate strains. in the medium run, sovereign balance sheets need to follow a credible path to ensure fiscal sustainability (see the october 2010 world economic outlook and the november 2010 fiscal monitor). sovereign refinancing risks should be addressed by debt management policies that lengthen the average maturity structures as market conditions permit. managing and reducing public contingent liabilities using price-based mechanisms should also be part of the plan.global financial stabilit y report sovereigns, funding, and systemic liquidity international monetary fund | october 2010 xiclarify and specify regulatory reforms. much of the proposed financial reform agenda remains unfinished. international rule-making bodies have made progress to identify the most egregious failings of the global finan-cial system in the run-up to the crisis, but their member countries have yet to agree on many of the details of the reforms. dealing with too-important-to-fail entities, strengthening supervisory incentives and resources, and devel-oping the macro-prudential framework are still under discussion. further progress will require a willingness to sup-press domestic interests in favor of a more stable and better functioning global financial system. the sooner reforms can be clarified, the sooner financial institutions can formulate their strategic priorities and business models. in the absence of such progress, regulatory inadequacies will continue for some time, increasing the chances of renewed financial instability.as part of these ongoing efforts, we welcome the recent proposals of the bcbs, which represent a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of capital in comparison with the pre-crisis situation. in particular, com-mon equity will represent a higher proportion of capital and thus allow for greater loss absorption. also, the amount of intangible and qualified assets that can be included in capital will be limited (to 15 percent). these include deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights, significant investments in common shares of financial institutions, and other intangible assets. phase-in arrangements have been developed to allow banks to move to these higher standards mainly through retention of earnings. as the global financial system stabilizes and the world economic recovery is firmly entrenched, phasing out intangibles completely and scaling back the transition period should be considered. this will raise banking sector resilience to absorb any future shocks that may lie ahead. furthermore, it is essential to make progress with the overall reform agenda. putting in place sound micro-prudential regulation is not suffi-cient. appropriate regulation needs to be developed with a macro-prudential approach to dampen procyclicality and to limit the systemic effects of financial institutions, some of which are not banks.overall, policymakers cannot relax their efforts to reduce refinancing risks, strengthen balance sheets, and reform regulatory frameworks. as apparent on several occasions over the past three years, conditions in the global financial system now have the potential of jumping from benign to crisis mode very rapidly. against this backdrop, policy-makers should not squander opportunities to strengthen and recapitalize banking systems, address too-important-to-fail entities, reduce contingent liabilities, and place sovereigns on a credible fiscal path. with the situation still fragile, some of the public support that has been given to banks in recent years will have to be continued. planned exit strategies from unconventional monetary and financial policies may need to be delayed until the situation is more robust. at the same time, it is important to ensure that the need for extraordinary support is temporary, as it is no substitute for repairing and reforming financial sectors, and realigning their incentives to build stronger bal-ance sheets and reduce excessive risk taking. for emerging markets, the policy challenges are different, with most of the financial system risks on the upside. many will need to cope with the effects of relative success, where maintaining stability will depend on their abil-ity to deal with surges in portfolio inflows. t raditional macroeconomic policies may need to be supplemented in some cases by macro-prudential measures as they may not be fully adequate to meet the macro-financial challenges arising from particular domestic circumstances, such as inflation pressures or asset bubbles. policies to address high and volatile capital flows are well known (see chapter 4 of the april 2010 gfsr and imf staff position note 10/04). moreover, emerging markets should continue to pursue policies aimed at fostering the development of local financial systems, so that they have the capacity to absorb and safely and efficiently intermediate higher volumes of capital flows. chapter 2: systemic liquidity riska defining characteristic of the crisis was the depth and duration of the systemic liquidity disruption to key fund-ing markets—that is, the simultaneous and protracted inability of financial institutions to roll over or obtain new short-term funding across both markets and borders. chapter 2 examines this episode and shows how banks became more vulnerable to a funding problem as a result of several factors: new suppliers of wholesale funds that were less-xii international monetary fund | october 2010stable providers; greater use of secured lending markets (repurchase agreements) based on cyclically high valuations of collateral (in particular for structured credit products) and insufficient margining processes; growing use of cross-border, short-term funding of longer-term assets in foreign currency; weaknesses in the infrastructure of associated markets; and a lack of information about counterparty risks. importantly, many were unaware about the extent of interactions between banks and nonbank institutions in the use of short-term funding markets. hence when central banks had to step in to stabilize markets, they had to extend liquidity to nonbanks, accept a larger diversity of col-lateral as protection for their lending, set up cross-border foreign currency swap lines, and engage in other actions, all of which raised moral hazard issues that remain unaddressed.making progress to mitigate systemic liquidity risk is difficult and not easily measured, as funding markets consist of a diverse set of institutions that interact in multiple markets, each with different infrastructure characteristics. chapter 2 examines this issue, both for institutions and markets. current proposals focus on micro-prudential mea-sures aimed at improving liquidity buffers and lowering asset/liability mismatches in individual banks—the bcbs proposals being most prominent. while helpful, addressing systemic liquidity risks by raising buffers at one institu-tion does not fully protect against a system-wide liquidity shortage. in these circumstances, central banks will likely need to step in as a liquidity provider of last resort to support markets and institutions. to avoid overuse of central bank facilities and to minimize moral hazard, the liquidity risk framework should focus on ensuring that banks and others considered important to liquidity and maturity transformation are contributing in some form to systemic risk insurance in good times. to do this effectively, a good measure of systemic liquidity risk will have to be developed. however, there are significant data gaps to be addressed in order to appropriately measure and monitor systemic liquidity risks.although mitigating systemic liquidity risk at the level of institutions is certainly part of the answer, funding mar-kets also need attention. policies to make secured funding markets, such as repurchase (“repo”) markets, function more effectively can help lower systemic risks and prevent liquidity constraints from turning into solvency concerns. specifically, better collateral valuation rules, margining policies, and the use of central counterparties could all help to lower vulnerabilities. preventing investor runs from money market mutual funds is also a necessary policy goal. the chapter recommends that stable net asset values (navs) not be used for investments in such funds, in order to ensure that fund investors better understand that the value of their investments will fluctuate with market condi-tions. this would need to be initiated carefully and in a period of stable funding conditions to ensure that such a change does not cause the run it was meant to prevent. other remedies, such as those suggested for banks (higher buffers and less maturity transformation), can also be used to deal with liquidity risks in these funds. in those cases where flexible navs are not instituted, it is crucial that such funds be subject to the same requirements as deposit-taking institutions.chapter 3: credit ratings the recent escalation of sovereign credit risk and the ratings downgrades of structured credit instruments over the last couple of years have highlighted the financial stability implications of credit rating agencies. does the informa-tion content provided by ratings have negative implications for financial stability, or is it the way they are used? chapter 3 sheds light on this issue, using sovereign debt ratings as its focus. the use of ratings is mandated in a number of regulatory environments—most notably in capital requirements for banks in the standardized approach of basel ii. many private sector entities—pension funds, insurance com-panies, and mutual funds—use ratings or ratings-based indices to make investment decisions. central banks also use ratings in their collateral policies. shifts in asset allocations based on ratings downgrades, for instance below an investment-grade rating, can be destabilizing, causing forced sales and so-called “cliff effects” in the pricing of such securities. the chapter finds that, indeed, ratings matter for the pricing of sovereign debt and that such cliff effects are most prominent when ratings fall below the investment grade barrier. in fact, even before an actual downgrade, global financial stabilit y report sovereigns, funding, and systemic liquidity international monetary fund | october 2010 ixthe setback in progress toward financial stability was precipitated by turmoil in the sovereign debt markets in europe, where increased vulnerabilities of sovereign and bank balance sheets became the focus of market concern. existing sovereign debt sustainability challenges, combined with concentrated short-term debt rollovers and an undi-versified investor base, left some euro area sovereigns vulnerable to funding pressures. these pressures spilled over to the banking sector, increasing the likelihood of a grim scenario of shrinking credit, slower growth, and weakening balance sheets. the forceful response at the national and supranational level to address sovereign risks and strengthen confidence in the financial system, including in particular through the provision of detailed information on bank balance sheets, helped to stabilize funding markets and mitigate risks, but conditions remain fragile. chapter 1 of this report presents an analysis of the challenges facing advanced countries as they deal with the juxtaposition of a slower recovery, higher debt levels and rollovers, and a still-impaired financial sector. the report starts from the premise that private and sovereign balance sheets will continue to strengthen in a gradually improving economic environment and that policy measures to address legacy problems in key banking systems are implemented alongside important stabilization policies. nonetheless, higher downside macroeconomic risks, sovereign financing pressures, and intensifying funding strains could produce a difficult environment, requiring adept policy maneuvering.in europe, coordinated support programs and the announcement of ambitious fiscal reforms in countries fac-ing the greatest funding difficulties helped contain the turmoil in the euro area after its rapid escalation in may. nevertheless, sovereign risks remain elevated as markets continue to focus on high public debt burdens, unfavorable growth dynamics, increased rollover risks, and linkages to the banking system. second-tier institutions and banks in countries whose sovereign spreads remain under pressure continue to have only limited access to funding markets and face rising costs. although governments have put in place national and supranational backstops to ensure that the global financial system is still in a period of significant uncertainty and remains the achilles’ heel of the economic recovery. although the ongoing recovery is expected to continue under the baseline scenario, resulting in a gradual strengthening of balance sheets, progress toward global financial sta-bility has experienced a setback since the april 2010 global financial stability report (gfsr). the recent turmoil in sovereign debt markets in europe highlighted increased vulnerabilities of bank and sovereign balance sheets arising from the crisis. the financial situation has subsequently improved, owing to the forceful response by policymakers which helped to stabilize funding markets and reduce tail risk, but substantial market uncertainties persist. global output has expanded in line with earlier projections, with growth in emerging market countries particularly strong. mature economies are transitioning from temporary support to more self-sustaining private demand. nevertheless, sover-eign balance sheets are highly vulnerable to growth shocks, making debt sustainability less certain. in this context, policymakers must tackle the following key reforms in order to ensure a viable global financial system and safeguard the recovery: (1) deal with the legacy problems in the banking sector, including, where necessary, recapitalization; (2) strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets; and (3) continue to clarify and specify regulatory reform, building on the substantial improve-ments proposed by the

weakness in the real estate sector constitutes an additional challenge in the united states. to a large extent, the apparently modest capital needs of u.s. banks reflect the large scale of government-sponsored enterprises and other government interventions without which those needs would have been substantially higher. this highlights the extent to which risk has been transferred from private to public balance sheets, as well as the need to address the burden placed on public institutions. in japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely. so far, the

stabilit y report sovereigns, funding, and systemic liquidity international monetary fund | october 2010 xiiiearly warnings via a negative “outlook” or “watch” recommendation convey even more information in advance of a downgrade and have a greater impact on market prices. as to accuracy, sovereign ratings are found to have generally performed well. sovereigns that have defaulted since 1975 were rated below investment-grade in the year prior to their default, suggesting that the ordinal ranking that agencies profess to use is meaningful. that said, recent changes in types of risks taken on by sovereigns (such as contingent liabilities from the banking sector) imply that better publicly available sovereign risk information would be helpful to rating agencies and investors.the credit rating agencies have attempted to produce stable “through-the-cycle” ratings to satisfy clients who find it costly to frequently alter trading decisions that are based on ratings. the chapter shows that a typical smoothing technique used by at least one rating agency is deemed likely to contribute to procyclicality in ratings compared to a method that accurately reflects current information at a “point in time.” this is because a “through-the-cycle” approach waits to detect whether the degradation is more permanent than temporary and larger than one notch. however, this often means that the lagged timing of the downgrade accentuates the already negative movement in credit quality. overall the chapter suggests the following policies to lessen some of the adverse side effects that ratings and rating agencies may have on financial stability. •\\\\t first,\\\\tregulators\\\\t should\\\\tremove\\\\treferences\\\\t to\\\\tratings\\\\tin\\\\ttheir\\\\tregulation\\\\t where\\\\tthey\\\\tare\\\\tlikely\\\\tto\\\\tcause\\\\tcliff\\\\teffects,\\\\tencouraging investors to rely more on their own due diligence. similarly, central banks should also establish their own

rely on wholesale funding, especially in cross-border markets, have faced severe and mounting reﬁ-xiiinance risks. central banks therefore are explor-ing more ways to extend term ﬁnancing to meet funding needs of institutions. the measures described above to boost capital and underpin asset valuations, as well as those already under-taken to provide liquidity, should provide essen-tial support for the markets to function properly and conﬁdence to be reestablished. continued progress on reducing counterparty risks, includ-ing centralized clearing and settlement arrange-ments, will also help.

of guarantees should include some cost to the institutions receiving coverage, such as a usage fee, fitness test, or other criteria. while these measures represent a broad approach, some of the speciﬁcs have already been put in place by various authorities, and there are encouraging signs that more are being considered. other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework. this opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. for now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.chapter 1against this backdrop, chapter 1 of the gfsrassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. it measures the reduction in leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. this analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. the most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.because the united states remains the epicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, chapter 1 examines u.s. prospects in some detail. the continuing decline in the u.s. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. with default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on u.s. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the april 2008 gfsr. with the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will increasingly face losses on non-u.s. assets as well. in some european countries, too, these difﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.financial institutions had been raising capital to bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. as a result, chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. a similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely

dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed. strains in funding xivmarkets have increased redemptions in money market mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. the far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the u.s. ﬁnancial landscape. while the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.the ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-ation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. to the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. whereas emerging markets overall had ini-tially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. the cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. there is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-cumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.chapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc policy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the analysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous gfsrs. although the focus has been on what the public sector should do, private sector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. the key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\\\x00maintain an orderly deleveraging process .financial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.v\\\\x00strengthen risk management systems . as part of overall risk management improvements, firms should endeavor to better align com -pensation packages to reward returns on a risk-adjusted basis using more robust risk management practices, with greater emphasis on the long-term component of compensation. v\\\\x00improve valuation techniques and reporting.implementation of new financial stability forum (fsf) disclosure guidelines and fre-quent asset valuations and timely disclosures will reduce uncertainty and are important steps that can help provide information about the health of counterparties.v\\\\x00develop better clearing and settlement mechanisms for over-the-counter products. private sector efforts to build clearing and settlement facilities to lower counterparty risks should continue apace, particularly for the credit default swaps market, where settlement issues need to be addressed urgently. higher capital charges for counterparty exposures would xixiconﬁdence in global ﬁnancial institutions and markets

mechanisms should minimize moral hazard, while recognizing the exigency of the situation and the evident need for public support. (5) pursue the medium-term objective of a more sound, competitive, and efﬁcient ﬁnancial system. achieving this objective requires both an orderly resolution of nonviable ﬁnancial institutions and a strengthening of the inter-national macroﬁnancial stability framework to help improve supervision and regulation at the domestic and global levels, as well as mecha-nisms to improve the effectiveness of market discipline. funding and securitization markets critical to pricing and intermediating credit should be strengthened, including by reducing counterparty risks through centralized clearing organizations.while satisfying these guiding principles, concrete actions are needed to tackle three interrelated areas associated with deleveraging: insufﬁcient capital, falling and uncertain asset valuations, and dysfunctional funding markets. arresting the spiraling interaction between these three elements is essential if there is to be a more orderly deleveraging process. capital. to keep private sector credit growing, even modestly, while strengthening bank capital ratios, the gfsr estimates some $675 billion in capital would be needed by the major global banks over the next several years. several mea-sures could be considered:v\\\\x00with many financial institutions finding it much more difficult to raise private capital at the present time, the authorities may need to inject capital into viable institutions. while there are many ways to accomplish this, it is preferable that the scheme provide some upside for the taxpayer, coupled with incen-tives for existing and new private shareholders to provide new capital.v\\\\x00though politically difficult, orderly resolution of nonviable banks would demonstrate a com-mitment to a competitive and well-capitalized banking system. assets. as private sector balance sheets shed assets to reduce leverage, the use of public sector balance sheets can help prevent “ﬁre-sale” liquidations that threaten to reduce bank capital.v\\\\x00countries whose banks have large expo-sures to securitized or problem assets could consider mechanisms for the government to purchase or provide long-term funding for such assets. this should create greater certainty about balance sheet health. setting up an asset management company provides a framework of legal clarity and accountability for the process. v\\\\x00allowing for a greater degree of judgment in the application of mark-to-market rules may avoid accelerating capital needs by reducing the pressure to value securities at low “fire-sale” prices. such judgment would require close supervision and should be accompanied by appropriate disclosure in order to avoid undermining confidence in balance sheets of existing institutions.funding. financial institutions that rely on wholesale funding, especially in cross-border markets, have faced severe and mounting reﬁ-xiiinance risks. central banks therefore are explor-ing more ways to extend term ﬁnancing to meet funding needs of institutions. the measures described above to boost capital and underpin asset valuations, as well as those already under-taken to provide liquidity, should provide essen-tial support for the markets to function properly and conﬁdence to be reestablished. continued progress on reducing counterparty risks, includ-ing centralized clearing and settlement arrange-ments, will also help. but experience in past crises indicates that in some circumstances addi-tional measures may be needed. under extreme circumstances:v\\\\x00deposit insurance of individual retail accounts could be expanded beyond normal limits. however, expansion of deposit insurance limits or, if conditions deteriorate further, use of a blanket guarantee should only be under-taken as a temporary, emergency measure and is best undertaken in a coordinated fashion across countries.v\\\\x00guarantees could cover senior and subordi-nated debt liabilities for a temporary period of time. ideally, these types of guarantees should include some cost to the institutions receiving coverage, such as a usage fee, fitness test, or other criteria. while these measures represent a broad approach, some of the speciﬁcs have already been put in place by various authorities, and there are encouraging signs that more are being considered. other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework. this opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. for now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.chapter 1against this backdrop, chapter 1 of the gfsrassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. it measures the reduction in leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. this analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. the most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.because the united states remains the epicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, chapter 1 examines u.s. prospects in some detail. the continuing decline in the u.s. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. with default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on u.s. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the april 2008 gfsr. with the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will increasingly face losses on non-u.s. assets as well. in some european countries, too, these difﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.financial institutions had been raising capital to bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. as a result, chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. a similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed. strains in funding xivmarkets have increased redemptions in money market mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. the far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the u.s. ﬁnancial landscape. while the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.the ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-ation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. to the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. whereas emerging markets overall had ini-tially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. the cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. there is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-cumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.chapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc policy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the analysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous gfsrs. although the focus has been on what the public sector should do, private sector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. the key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\\\x00maintain an orderly deleveraging process .financial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.v\\\\x00strengthen risk management systems . as part of overall risk management improvements, firms should endeavor to better align com -pensation packages to reward returns on a risk-adjusted basis using more robust risk management practices, with greater emphasis on the long-term component of compensation. v\\\\x00improve valuation techniques and reporting.implementation of new financial stability forum (fsf) disclosure guidelines and fre-quent asset valuations and timely disclosures will reduce uncertainty and are important steps that can help provide information about the health of counterparties.v\\\\x00develop better clearing and settlement mechanisms for over-the-counter products. private sector efforts to build clearing and settlement facilities to lower counterparty risks should continue apace, particularly for the credit default swaps market, where settlement issues need to be addressed urgently. higher capital charges for counterparty exposures would xvhelp and are being considered by various regulators.chapter 2the combination of liquidity and solvency risks has led to a period of elevated short-term interest rate spreads and substantially reduced transaction volumes, with funding markets remaining stressed for an unprecedented period. chapter 2 delves into the ongoing inability of the bank funding markets to per-form their role in distributing liquidity across banks and near-banks and the consequences for the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission.the chapter ﬁrst notes that the short-term rates-setting procedures, including for lon-don interbank offer rates (libor) and the euribor rate, are not broken, but improve-ments are desirable, since the libor rates are estimated to underpin some $400 trillion of ﬁnancial derivatives contracts. although most of the analysis in the chapter preceded the most recent steep rise in libor rates, the basic recommendations remain intact. in examining the reasons for the elevated spreads between the libor and the overnight index swap (ois) market, the chapter conﬁrms that default concerns became the overriding component of the u.s. dollar libor-ois spread starting in early 2008. in addition, foreign currency swap spreads explain the euribor-ois and sterling libor-ois spreads, signifying that u.s. dollar liquidity pressures are spilling over into these other currencies. the chapter also examines how the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission has been affected by the crisis, in light of three longer-term trends: increased growth of activity in near-banks, more extensive use of wholesale funding markets, and a movement away from a stable deposit base to a larger proportion of funding obtained with short-term maturities. although these trends have generally made interest rate transmission more stable, over the last year the smooth relationships between the policy rate and lending rates that had been established changed dramatically, particularly for the united states. from mid-2007 until june 2008, the reliability of forecasting lending rates for both the united states and for the euro area has deteriorated, but more so for the united states.the chapter recommends:v\\\\x00improving infrastructure in funding markets.specifically, for the calculation of the libor, a larger sample of banks and quotes that also includes nonbank sources of unsecured term funding, as well as publishing aggregate vol-ume data, would engender greater confidence in these benchmark rates.v\\\\x00more attention to both credit and liquidity risks by the authorities. since wide interbank spreads were driven primarily by bank distress risks (encompassing both credit and liquidity risks), it is unlikely that ever-easier access to emergency liquidity from central banks will relieve the continued stress in interbank fund-ing. public authorities will need to continue to address counterparty risks, since private institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.v\\\\x00limited indirect support to money markets. centralbank lending facilities aimed at restoring the functioning of interbank markets to transmit monetary policy need to be designed care-fully. they should provide incentives for market participants to start dealing among themselves and thus to allow for an orderly exit by the central bank once more extreme strains have eased. the european central bank’s alterations to its collateral policies beginning next year is a step in this direction.v\\\\x00encouraging central bank cooperation and com-munication. recent experience has highlighted the importance of properly functioning forex swap markets in addition to local money mar-kets. in particular, the latest round of liquid-ity distress was countered by the cooperative actions of major central banks to address foreign currency funding needs. regular communication by central banks about their actions and reasons for them can reduce xixiconﬁdence in global ﬁnancial institutions and markets has been badly shaken. threats to systemic stability became manifest in september with the collapse or near-collapse of several key institutions. the october 2008 world economic outlook notes that the strains afﬂicting the global ﬁnancial system are expected to deepen the downturn in global growth and restrain the recovery. moreover, the risk of a more severe adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the broader economy represents a critical threat. the combination of mounting losses, falling asset prices, and a deepening economic downturn, has caused serious doubts about the viability of a widening swath of the ﬁnancial system. the ongoing deleveraging process outlined in the april 2008 gfsr has accelerated and become disorderly—marked by a rapid decline in ﬁnancial institutions’ share prices, higher costs of funding and credit default protection, and depressed asset prices. one result has been sudden failures of institutions as markets have become unwilling (or unable) to provide capital and funding or absorb assets. piecemeal interventions to address the attendant liquidity strains and resolve the troubled institutions did not succeed in restoring market conﬁdence, as they have not addressed the widespread nature of the underlying problems. the intensifying worries about counterparty risks have created a near lock-up of global money markets. chapter 1 provides the basis for a more comprehensive policy approach—as is now being considered in some countries. it evaluates how far the delever-aging process has progressed and how much lies ahead. it also suggests a comprehensive set of measures that could arrest the currently destruc-tive process. restoration of ﬁnancial stability would now beneﬁt from a publicly-stated collective commit-ment by the authorities of the affected countries to address the issue in a consistent and coherent manner. while the precise measures will inevi-tably differ across countries, experience from earlier crises indicates that ﬁve principles could serve to guide the scope and design of measures that could form the basis for a restoration of conﬁdence in these exceptional circumstances. these include:(1) employ measures that are comprehensive, timely, and clearly communicated. they should encompass the principal challenges arising from the strains of deleveraging: namely, improving funding availability, cost, and maturity to stabilize balance sheets; injecting capital to support viable institutions with sound underpinnings that are currently unable to provide adequate credit; and with ﬁnancial markets worldwide facing growing turmoil, internationally coherent and decisive policy measures will be required to restore conﬁdence in the global ﬁnancial system. failure to do so could usher in a period in which the ongoing deleveraging process becomes increasingly disorderly and costly for the real economy. in any case, the process of restoring an orderly system will be challenging, as a signiﬁcant deleveraging is both necessary and inevitable. it is against this challenging and still evolving backdrop that the global financial stability report (gfsr) frames the recent events to suggest potential policy measures that could be helpful in the current circumstances. xiibuttressing troubled assets by using public sector balance sheets to promote orderly deleverag-ing. in applying existing or new regulations, authorities should avoid exacerbating procyclical effects. the objectives of the measures should be clear and operational procedures transparent.(2) aim for a consistent and coherent set of policies across countries to stabilize the global ﬁnancial system in order to maximize impact while avoiding adverse effects on other countries.(3) ensure rapid response on the basis of early detection of strains. this requires a high degree of coordination within each country, and in many cases across borders, and a framework that allows for decisive action by potentially dif-ferent sets of authorities.(4) assure that emergency government inter-ventions are temporary and taxpayer interests are protected. accountability of government actions is important for all stakeholders and the conditions for support should include private participation in downside risks and taxpayer participation in upside beneﬁts. intervention

operational procedures would also aid in achieving this goal. chapter 3since the crisis began, the role of fair value accounting (fva) practices has been under close scrutiny. chapter 3 examines the poten-tial procyclical role that the application of fva methods may have played in the development and outcome of the current credit cycle. using actual accounting data from ﬁve repre-sentative types of ﬁnancial institutions, this chap-ter simulates the balance sheet effects of several shocks calibrated to recent events. the analysis conﬁrms that, depending on the types of assets and liabilities present on the balance sheet, these shocks amplify cyclical ﬂuctuations of valu-ations. the simulations are also used to examine potential adjustments surrounding fva meth-ods, showing such adjustments act as expected to smooth the cyclical variation, but by doing so the assigned valuations do not represent fair values. it is worth recognizing, however, that in some cases, such as in highly illiquid markets or in buoyant or dire circumstances, fva can also produce valuations that do not reﬂect longer-term fundamentals and the cash ﬂows and risks under consideration. overall, the chapter concludes that the appli-cation of fva is still the way forward, but that further enhancements of fva methodologies are needed to help mitigate the exaggerated effects of some valuation techniques. a key chal-lenge will be to enrich the fva framework so that it can contribute to better market discipline and ﬁnancial stability. the various accounting, prudential, and risk management approaches to valuation should be reconciled so that they work together to promote a more stable ﬁnancial system. importantly, this will require adjustments on the part of all three disciplines to ensure consistency. the policy recommendations are:v\\\\x00selectively add information on valuation. account-ing valuations themselves need to be supple-mented with additional information, such as the expected variation of fair value valuations, modeling techniques, and assumptions, so that the user can appropriately assess the risks of the institution. v\\\\x00raise capital buffers and provisions. higher capital buffers and the use of forward-looking provisioning would help protect against the downturn in the cycle. if protection against the full magnitude of the downward cycle is desired, then the simulations suggest that building up a capital cushion of some 30–40 percent above normal levels in good times would be required to absorb the most severe shocks.v\\\\x00provide targeted risk disclosures. firms could contemplate providing more focused report-ing that is meant to satisfy different needs of users. shorter reports at higher frequencies may be better than longer reports and lower frequencies, depending on the intended audience.chapter 4emerging market (em) countries have not been at the forefront of the crisis, but their vulnerability to knock-on effects should not be underestimated. chapter 4 examines equity markets in em countries to assess the extent to which external/global and domestic/fundamental factors drive equity market valuations. it conﬁrms that global factors are important in explaining the movement in em equity prices, as are domestic fundamentals. using various measures of correlation, chap-ter 4 also ﬁnds that the scope for spillovers to emerging equity markets has risen, suggesting a growing transmission channel for equity price movements. this can, in turn, affect consump-tion and investment in emerging markets, although such macroﬁnancial linkages are found to be small and they tend to play out gradually. nevertheless, it suggests that policy-makers need to remain engaged over the longer run in building resilience in their local ﬁnan-cial markets. xixiconﬁdence in global ﬁnancial institutions and markets has been badly shaken. threats to systemic stability became manifest in september with the collapse or near-collapse of several key institutions. the october 2008 world economic outlook notes that the strains afﬂicting the global ﬁnancial system are expected to deepen the downturn in global growth and restrain the recovery. moreover, the risk of a more severe adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the broader economy represents a critical threat. the combination of mounting losses, falling asset prices, and a deepening economic downturn, has caused serious doubts about the viability of a widening swath of the ﬁnancial system. the ongoing deleveraging process outlined in the april 2008 gfsr has accelerated and become disorderly—marked by a rapid decline in ﬁnancial institutions’ share prices, higher costs of funding and credit default protection, and depressed asset prices. one result has been sudden failures of institutions as markets have become unwilling (or unable) to provide capital and funding or absorb assets. piecemeal interventions to address the attendant liquidity strains and resolve the troubled institutions did not succeed in restoring market conﬁdence, as they have not addressed the widespread nature of the underlying problems. the intensifying worries about counterparty risks have created a near lock-up of global money markets. chapter 1 provides the basis for a more comprehensive policy approach—as is now being considered in some countries. it evaluates how far the delever-aging process has progressed and how much lies ahead. it also suggests a comprehensive set of measures that could arrest the currently destruc-tive process. restoration of ﬁnancial stability would now beneﬁt from a publicly-stated collective commit-ment by the authorities of the affected countries to address the issue in a consistent and coherent manner. while the precise measures will inevi-tably differ across countries, experience from earlier crises indicates that ﬁve principles could serve to guide the scope and design of measures that could form the basis for a restoration of conﬁdence in these exceptional circumstances. these include:(1) employ measures that are comprehensive, timely, and clearly communicated. they should encompass the principal challenges arising from the strains of deleveraging: namely, improving funding availability, cost, and maturity to stabilize balance sheets; injecting capital to support viable institutions with sound underpinnings that are currently unable to provide adequate credit; and with ﬁnancial markets worldwide facing growing turmoil, internationally coherent and decisive policy measures will be required to restore conﬁdence in the global ﬁnancial system. failure to do so could usher in a period in which the ongoing deleveraging process becomes increasingly disorderly and costly for the real economy. in any case, the process of restoring an orderly system will be challenging, as a signiﬁcant deleveraging is both necessary and inevitable. it is against this challenging and still evolving backdrop that the global financial stability report (gfsr) frames the recent events to suggest potential policy measures that could be helpful in the current circumstances. xiibuttressing troubled assets by using public sector balance sheets to promote orderly deleverag-ing. in applying existing or new regulations, authorities should avoid exacerbating procyclical effects. the objectives of the measures should be clear and operational procedures transparent.(2) aim for a consistent and coherent set of policies across countries to stabilize the global ﬁnancial system in order to maximize impact while avoiding adverse effects on other countries.(3) ensure rapid response on the basis of early detection of strains. this requires a high degree of coordination within each country, and in many cases across borders, and a framework that allows for decisive action by potentially dif-ferent sets of authorities.(4) assure that emergency government inter-ventions are temporary and taxpayer interests are protected. accountability of government actions is important for all stakeholders and the conditions for support should include private participation in downside risks and taxpayer participation in upside beneﬁts. intervention mechanisms should minimize moral hazard, while recognizing the exigency of the situation and the evident need for public support. (5) pursue the medium-term objective of a more sound, competitive, and efﬁcient ﬁnancial system. achieving this objective requires both an orderly resolution of nonviable ﬁnancial institutions and a strengthening of the inter-national macroﬁnancial stability framework to help improve supervision and regulation at the domestic and global levels, as well as mecha-nisms to improve the effectiveness of market discipline. funding and securitization markets critical to pricing and intermediating credit should be strengthened, including by reducing counterparty risks through centralized clearing organizations.while satisfying these guiding principles, concrete actions are needed to tackle three interrelated areas associated with deleveraging: insufﬁcient capital, falling and uncertain asset valuations, and dysfunctional funding markets. arresting the spiraling interaction between these three elements is essential if there is to be a more orderly deleveraging process. capital. to keep private sector credit growing, even modestly, while strengthening bank capital ratios, the gfsr estimates some $675 billion in capital would be needed by the major global banks over the next several years. several mea-sures could be considered:v\\\\x00with many financial institutions finding it much more difficult to raise private capital at the present time, the authorities may need to inject capital into viable institutions. while there are many ways to accomplish this, it is preferable that the scheme provide some upside for the taxpayer, coupled with incen-tives for existing and new private shareholders to provide new capital.v\\\\x00though politically difficult, orderly resolution of nonviable banks would demonstrate a com-mitment to a competitive and well-capitalized banking system. assets. as private sector balance sheets shed assets to reduce leverage, the use of public sector balance sheets can help prevent “ﬁre-sale” liquidations that threaten to reduce bank capital.v\\\\x00countries whose banks have large expo-sures to securitized or problem assets could consider mechanisms for the government to purchase or provide long-term funding for such assets. this should create greater certainty about balance sheet health. setting up an asset management company provides a framework of legal clarity and accountability for the process. v\\\\x00allowing for a greater degree of judgment in the application of mark-to-market rules may avoid accelerating capital needs by reducing the pressure to value securities at low “fire-sale” prices. such judgment would require close supervision and should be accompanied by appropriate disclosure in order to avoid undermining confidence in balance sheets of existing institutions.funding. financial institutions that rely on wholesale funding, especially in cross-border markets, have faced severe and mounting reﬁ-xiiinance risks. central banks therefore are explor-ing more ways to extend term ﬁnancing to meet funding needs of institutions. the measures described above to boost capital and underpin asset valuations, as well as those already under-taken to provide liquidity, should provide essen-tial support for the markets to function properly and conﬁdence to be reestablished. continued progress on reducing counterparty risks, includ-ing centralized clearing and settlement arrange-ments, will also help. but experience in past crises indicates that in some circumstances addi-tional measures may be needed. under extreme circumstances:v\\\\x00deposit insurance of individual retail accounts could be expanded beyond normal limits. however, expansion of deposit insurance limits or, if conditions deteriorate further, use of a blanket guarantee should only be under-taken as a temporary, emergency measure and is best undertaken in a coordinated fashion across countries.v\\\\x00guarantees could cover senior and subordi-nated debt liabilities for a temporary period of time. ideally, these types of guarantees should include some cost to the institutions receiving coverage, such as a usage fee, fitness test, or other criteria. while these measures represent a broad approach, some of the speciﬁcs have already been put in place by various authorities, and there are encouraging signs that more are being considered. other positive developments include the resolve and determination of the authorities to act decisively; the signiﬁcant balance sheet adjustments already under way; and an openness to revisit the global regulatory framework. this opens a window of opportunity to better align regulation and incentives in vari-ous jurisdictions in the medium run. for now, however, the principal focus will remain that of containing existing disruptive forces.chapter 1against this backdrop, chapter 1 of the gfsrassesses the extent of further losses faced by global institutions. it measures the reduction in leverage needed in the ﬁnancial system, estimates the amount of assets that need to be shed, and calculates the amount of capital to be raised. this analysis concludes that public resources will be needed to ensure a return to ﬁnancial stability and a more orderly deleverag-ing process that avoids a severe credit crunch. the most signiﬁcant risk remains the intensiﬁca-tion of the adverse feedback loop between the ﬁnancial system and the real economy.because the united states remains the epicenter of the ﬁnancial crisis, chapter 1 examines u.s. prospects in some detail. the continuing decline in the u.s. housing market and wider economic slowdown is contributing to new loan deterioration—delinquencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate as well as corporate and consumer loans are increasing. with default rates yet to peak and the recent heightened market distress, declared losses on u.s. loans and securitized assets are likely to increase further to about $1.4 tril-lion, signiﬁcantly higher than the estimate in the april 2008 gfsr. with the economic slowdown spreading, ﬁnancial institutions will increasingly face losses on non-u.s. assets as well. in some european countries, too, these difﬁculties are being accentuated by weakening local housing markets.financial institutions had been raising capital to bolster their balance sheets and these efforts were initially successful, but now the prospects for further issuance are more limited and more expensive, reﬂecting weaker conﬁdence in the underlying viability of institutions. as a result, chapter 1 suggests that the deleveraging in the banking sector will take place along multiple dimensions: requiring asset sales, slower new asset growth, and radical changes to banks’ business models as many previous sources of revenue have nearly disappeared. a similar dele-veraging process is under way for many non-banks, such as hedge funds, where the ability to use margin ﬁnancing and private repurchase (repo) markets to take leveraged positions has been severely curtailed. strains in funding xivmarkets have increased redemptions in money market mutual funds and exacerbated rollover risks for corporate borrowers. the far-reach-ing nature of the events that are unfolding is illustrated by the fact that within a period of one week, large stand-alone investment banks disappeared from the u.s. ﬁnancial landscape. while the long-run implications are not certain, ﬁnancial sectors are likely to consolidate, new business models will need to be found, and ﬁrms will operate with less leverage in the fore-seeable future.the ongoing uncertainty surrounding valu-ation of what were once thought to be low-risk assets has led to difﬁculties in judging capital adequacy. chapter 1 observes that most market participants, rating agencies, and regulators agree that capital buffers will need to be higher than previously thought. moreover, they should be based on a forward-looking analysis of risk, rather than a mechanical application of regu-latory ratios. to the extent that the move to permanently higher capital ratios is mandated, the ratios should be phased in so that their attainment does not amplify the existing cyclical downturn. though achieving higher levels will further slow the restoration of normal credit conditions, the process should be under way by late 2009 to put ﬁnancial institutions in a better position to support the recovery. whereas emerging markets overall had ini-tially remained fairly resilient to global ﬁnan-cial turmoil, they have recently come under increasing pressure. the cost and availability of ﬁnancing have become more difﬁcult and equity markets have corrected sharply, albeit from elevated levels. capital outﬂows have intensiﬁed, leading to tighter international and, in some cases, domestic liquidity conditions. borrowers and ﬁnancial institutions in emerging markets will be confronted with a more trying macroeconomic environment. policymakers, too, face challenges as global growth slows and the lagged pass-through of domestic inﬂation-ary pressures continues—and all this against the backdrop of lower conﬁdence and the reversal of earlier ﬂows into these markets. there is an important risk that such a conﬂuence of cir-cumstances could accelerate a downturn in the domestic credit cycle in some emerging market economies.chapter 1 also lays out some more speciﬁc policy implications for public authorities than those presented above, building on the analysis in the chapter and conclusions of previous gfsrs. although the focus has been on what the public sector should do, private sector ﬁnancial institutions continue to play a crucial role in identifying and rectifying deﬁciencies in order to place ﬁnancial inter-mediation on a more sound footing. the key elements, which will need to be reinforced through support from regulators and supervi-sors, are:v\\\\x00maintain an orderly deleveraging process .financial institutions should, first, focus on strengthening their balance sheets—prefer-ably by attracting new capital rather than selling assets; and second, ensure adequate funding sources consistent with their business model.v\\\\x00strengthen risk management systems . as part of overall risk management improvements, firms should endeavor to better align com -pensation packages to reward returns on a risk-adjusted basis using more robust risk management practices, with greater emphasis on the long-term component of compensation. v\\\\x00improve valuation techniques and reporting.implementation of new financial stability forum (fsf) disclosure guidelines and fre-quent asset valuations and timely disclosures will reduce uncertainty and are important steps that can help provide information about the health of counterparties.v\\\\x00develop better clearing and settlement mechanisms for over-the-counter products. private sector efforts to build clearing and settlement facilities to lower counterparty risks should continue apace, particularly for the credit default swaps market, where settlement issues need to be addressed urgently. higher capital charges for counterparty exposures would xvhelp and are being considered by various regulators.chapter 2the combination of liquidity and solvency risks has led to a period of elevated short-term interest rate spreads and substantially reduced transaction volumes, with funding markets remaining stressed for an unprecedented period. chapter 2 delves into the ongoing inability of the bank funding markets to per-form their role in distributing liquidity across banks and near-banks and the consequences for the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission.the chapter ﬁrst notes that the short-term rates-setting procedures, including for lon-don interbank offer rates (libor) and the euribor rate, are not broken, but improve-ments are desirable, since the libor rates are estimated to underpin some $400 trillion of ﬁnancial derivatives contracts. although most of the analysis in the chapter preceded the most recent steep rise in libor rates, the basic recommendations remain intact. in examining the reasons for the elevated spreads between the libor and the overnight index swap (ois) market, the chapter conﬁrms that default concerns became the overriding component of the u.s. dollar libor-ois spread starting in early 2008. in addition, foreign currency swap spreads explain the euribor-ois and sterling libor-ois spreads, signifying that u.s. dollar liquidity pressures are spilling over into these other currencies. the chapter also examines how the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission has been affected by the crisis, in light of three longer-term trends: increased growth of activity in near-banks, more extensive use of wholesale funding markets, and a movement away from a stable deposit base to a larger proportion of funding obtained with short-term maturities. although these trends have generally made interest rate transmission more stable, over the last year the smooth relationships between the policy rate and lending rates that had been established changed dramatically, particularly for the united states. from mid-2007 until june 2008, the reliability of forecasting lending rates for both the united states and for the euro area has deteriorated, but more so for the united states.the chapter recommends:v\\\\x00improving infrastructure in funding markets.specifically, for the calculation of the libor, a larger sample of banks and quotes that also includes nonbank sources of unsecured term funding, as well as publishing aggregate vol-ume data, would engender greater confidence in these benchmark rates.v\\\\x00more attention to both credit and liquidity risks by the authorities. since wide interbank spreads were driven primarily by bank distress risks (encompassing both credit and liquidity risks), it is unlikely that ever-easier access to emergency liquidity from central banks will relieve the continued stress in interbank fund-ing. public authorities will need to continue to address counterparty risks, since private institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.v\\\\x00limited indirect support to money markets. centralbank lending facilities aimed at restoring the functioning of interbank markets to transmit monetary policy need to be designed care-fully. they should provide incentives for market participants to start dealing among themselves and thus to allow for an orderly exit by the central bank once more extreme strains have eased. the european central bank’s alterations to its collateral policies beginning next year is a step in this direction.v\\\\x00encouraging central bank cooperation and com-munication. recent experience has highlighted the importance of properly functioning forex swap markets in addition to local money mar-kets. in particular, the latest round of liquid-ity distress was countered by the cooperative actions of major central banks to address foreign currency funding needs. regular communication by central banks about their actions and reasons for them can reduce xivuncertainties. continued convergence of their operational procedures would also aid in achieving this goal. chapter 3since the crisis began, the role of fair value accounting (fva) practices has been under close scrutiny. chapter 3 examines the poten-tial procyclical role that the application of fva methods may have played in the development and outcome of the current credit cycle. using actual accounting data from ﬁve repre-sentative types of ﬁnancial institutions, this chap-ter simulates the balance sheet effects of several shocks calibrated to recent events. the analysis conﬁrms that, depending on the types of assets and liabilities present on the balance sheet, these shocks amplify cyclical ﬂuctuations of valu-ations. the simulations are also used to examine potential adjustments surrounding fva meth-ods, showing such adjustments act as expected to smooth the cyclical variation, but by doing so the assigned valuations do not represent fair values. it is worth recognizing, however, that in some cases, such as in highly illiquid markets or in buoyant or dire circumstances, fva can also produce valuations that do not reﬂect longer-term fundamentals and the cash ﬂows and risks under consideration. overall, the chapter concludes that the appli-cation of fva is still the way forward, but that further enhancements of fva methodologies are needed to help mitigate the exaggerated effects of some valuation techniques. a key chal-lenge will be to enrich the fva framework so that it can contribute to better market discipline and ﬁnancial stability. the various accounting, prudential, and risk management approaches to valuation should be reconciled so that they work together to promote a more stable ﬁnancial system. importantly, this will require adjustments on the part of all three disciplines to ensure consistency. the policy recommendations are:v\\\\x00selectively add information on valuation. account-ing valuations themselves need to be supple-mented with additional information, such as the expected variation of fair value valuations, modeling techniques, and assumptions, so that the user can appropriately assess the risks of the institution. v\\\\x00raise capital buffers and provisions. higher capital buffers and the use of forward-looking provisioning would help protect against the downturn in the cycle. if protection against the full magnitude of the downward cycle is desired, then the simulations suggest that building up a capital cushion of some 30–40 percent above normal levels in good times would be required to absorb the most severe shocks.v\\\\x00provide targeted risk disclosures. firms could contemplate providing more focused report-ing that is meant to satisfy different needs of users. shorter reports at higher frequencies may be better than longer reports and lower frequencies, depending on the intended audience.chapter 4emerging market (em) countries have not been at the forefront of the crisis, but their vulnerability to knock-on effects should not be underestimated. chapter 4 examines equity markets in em countries to assess the extent to which external/global and domestic/fundamental factors drive equity market valuations. it conﬁrms that global factors are important in explaining the movement in em equity prices, as are domestic fundamentals. using various measures of correlation, chap-ter 4 also ﬁnds that the scope for spillovers to emerging equity markets has risen, suggesting a growing transmission channel for equity price movements. this can, in turn, affect consump-tion and investment in emerging markets, although such macroﬁnancial linkages are found to be small and they tend to play out gradually. nevertheless, it suggests that policy-makers need to remain engaged over the longer run in building resilience in their local ﬁnan-cial markets.xviispeciﬁcally, the standard policies that could help to make markets more resilient in the medium run are well-known and typically include:v\\\\x00fostering a broader and more diversified inves-tor base. encourage a diversity of investors, including institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, which tend to have long-term investment horizons.v\\\\x00aiding price discovery. remove impediments to price discovery by avoiding artificial delays in revealing prices or limiting price movements.v\\\\x00supporting infrastructure development. adoptlegal, regulatory, and prudential rules that are consistent with international best practice. v\\\\x00ensuring stock exchanges are well run. a robust trading environment and supporting infra-structure for trading equities and new finan-cial instruments can also help develop capital markets, although enhancements and innova-tion need to be properly sequenced. * * *a number of the policy lessons arising from the crisis are now beginning to be implemented and many more will need to be formulated and evaluated before coming into effect. the imf has been active in the debates on a number of items, some of which have been covered in this latest gfsr. while not all the policy recommendations in the april 2008 gfsr are repeated here, they remain relevant. the imf will continue to cooperate with the fsf, moni-tor progress, and assist its member countries through its bilateral surveillance, including the financial sector assessment program, and tech-nical assistance to make their ﬁnancial systems healthier and more resilient to global ﬁnancial sector risks.']\",\n",

would have on others. the methodology relies on techniques already employed by supervisors and the private sector to manage risk. other regulatory measures, of course, are also possible, such as those discussed in secti on f of chapter 1, and merit further analysis. as important as the types of regulations to put into place is the question of who should do it. chapter 2 also asks whether some recent reform proposals that add the task of monitoring the build -up of syst emic risks to the role of regulators would help to mitigate such risks. the chapter finds that a unified regulator —one that oversees liquidity and solvency issues —removes some of the conflicting incentives that result from the separation of these powers, but nonetheless if it is mandated to oversee systemic risks it would still be softer on systemically important institutions than on those that are not. this arises because the failure of one of these institutions would cause disproportionate damage to the financial system and regulators would be loathe to see serial failures. to truly address systemic risks, regulators need additional tools explicitly tied to their mandate to monitor systemic risks —altering the structure of regulatory bodies is not enough . such tools could include systemic -risk-based capital surcharges, levies on institutions in ways directly related to their contribution to systemic risk, or perhaps even limiting the size of certain business activities. another approach to improving fina ncial stability is to beef up the infrastructure underling financial markets to make them more resilient to the distress of individual financial institutions. one of the major initiatives is to move over -the-counter (otc) derivatives contracts to central counterparties (ccps) for clearing. chapter 3 examines how such a move could lower systemic counterparty credit risks, but notes that once contracts are placed in a ccp it is essential that the risk management standards are high and back -up plans to prevent a failure of the ccp itself are well designed. in the global context, strict regulatory oversight, including a set of international guidelines, is warranted. such a set of guidelines is currently being crafted jointly by the international organization of securities commissions and the committee on payments and settlement systems. the chapter also notes that while moving otc derivative contracts to a ccp will likely lower systemic risks by reducing the counterparty risks associated with trading these contr acts, such a move will bring with it transition costs due to the need to post large amounts of additional collateral at the ccp. this calls for a gradual transition. given these costs, however, the incentive to voluntarily move contracts to the safer envir onment may be low and it may need more regulatory encouragement. one way, for example, would be to raise capital charges or attach a levy on derivative exposures that represent a dealer’s payments to their other counterparties in case of their own failure —that is, their contribution to systemic risk in the otc market. in sum, the future financial regulatory reform agenda is still a work in progress, but will need to move forward with at least the main ingredients soon. the window of opportunity for dealing xi    risks to global financial stability have eased as the economic recovery has gained steam, but concerns about advanced country sovereign risks could undermine stability gains and prolong the collapse of credit. without more fully restoring the health of fin ancial and household balance sheets, a worsening of public debt sustainability could be transmitted back to banking systems or across borders. hence, policies are needed to (1) reduce sovereign vulnerabilities, including through communicating credible med ium-term fiscal consolidation plans; (2) ensure that the ongoing deleveraging process unfolds smoothly; and (3) decisively move forward to complete the regulatory agenda so as to move to a safer, more resilient, and dynamic global financial system. for eme rging market countries, where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation and asset price bubbles, a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies is advisable. with the global economy improving ( see the april 2010 world economic outlook ), risks to financial stability have subsided. nonetheless, the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt have altered the global risk profile. vulnerabilities now increasingly emana te from concerns over the sustainability of governments’ balance sheets. in some cases, the longer -run solvency concerns could translate into short -term strains in funding markets as investors require higher yields to compensate for potential future risks. such strains can intensify the short -term funding challenges facing advanced country banks and may have negative implications for a recovery of private credit. these interactions are covered in chapter 1 of this report. banking system health is generally improving alongside the economic recovery, continued deleveraging, and normalizing markets. our estimates of bank writedowns since the start of the crisis through 2010 have been reduced to $2.3 trillion from $2.8 trillion in the october 2009 global financ ial stability report . as a result, bank capital needs have declined substantially, although segments of banking systems in some countries remain capital deficient, mainly as a result of losses related to commercial real estate. even though capital needs ha ve fallen, banks still face considerable challenges: a large amount of short -term funding will need to be refinanced this year and next; more and higher -quality capital will likely be needed to satisfy investors in anticipation of upcoming more stringent r egulation; and not all losses have been written down to date. in addition to these challenges, new regulations will also require banks to rethink their business strategies. all of these factors are likely to put downward pressure on profitability. in such an environment, the recovery of private sector credit is likely to be subdued as credit demand is weak and supply is constrained. households and corporates need to reduce their debt levels and restore their balance sheets. even with low demand, the balloon ing sovereign financing needs may bump up against limited credit supply, which could contribute to upward pressure on global financial stability report international monetary fund | april 2010 xii interest rates (see section d of chapter 1) and increase funding pressures for banks. small and medium -sized enterprises are feeling the b runt of the reduction in credit . thus, policy measures to address supply constraints may still be needed in some economies. in contrast, some emerging market economies have experienced a resurgence of capital flows. strong recoveries, expectations of appreciating currencies, as well as ample liquidity and low interest rates in the major advanced countries form the backdrop for portfolio capital inflows to asia (excluding japan) and latin america (see section e of chapter 1, and chapter 4). while the resumption of capital flows is welcome, in some cases this has led to concerns about the potential for inflationary pressures and a sset price bubbles, which could compromise monetary and financial stability. however, with the exception of some local property markets, there is only limited evidence of this actually happening so far. nonetheless, current conditions warrant close scrutiny and early policy action so as not to compromise financial stability. chapter 4 notes that there are strong links between global liquidity expansion and asset prices in “liquidity -receiving” economies. the work shows that capital inflows in the rec eiving economies are less problematic if exchange rates are flexible and capital outflows are liberalized. moreover, policymakers in these economies are encouraged to use a wide range of policy options in response to the surge in flows —namely macroeconomic policies and prudential regulations. if these policy measures are insufficient and the capital flows are likely to be temporary, judicious use of capital controls could be considered.  main policy messages to address sovereign risks, credible medium -term fiscal consolidation plans that command public support are needed. this is the most daunting challenge facing governments in the near term. consolidation plans should be made transparent, and contingency measures should be in place if the degradation of public finances is greater than expected. better fiscal frameworks and growth -enhancing structural reforms will help ground public confidence that the fiscal consolidation process is consistent with long -term growth. in the near term, the banking systems in a number of countries still require attention so as to reestablish a healthy core set of viable banks that can get private credit flowing again. policies need to focus on the “right sizing” of a vital and sound financial system. while deleveraging has occurred mostly on the asset side of banks’ balance sheets, funding and liability -side pressures are coming to the fore. further efforts to address a number of weak banks are still necessary to ensure a smooth exit from the extraordinary central bank suppo rt of funding and liquidity. the key will be for policymakers to ensure fair competition consistent with a well -functioning and safe banking system. while certain central banks and governments may need to continue to provide some support, others should s tand ready to reinstate it, if needed, to avert a return of funding market disruptions. looking further ahead, the regulatory reforms need to move forward expeditiously after being adequately calibrated, and be introduced in a manner that accounts for the current economic and financial conditions. it is already clear that the reforms to make the financial system safer will entail more and better quality capital and improvements in liquidity management and buffers. these microprudential measures will help r emove excess capacity and restrict a build -up in leverage. while the direction of the reforms is clear, the magnitude is not. furthermore, questions remain about how policymakers will deal with the capacity of too -important -to-fail institutions to harm the financial system and to generate costs for the public sector and its taxpayers. in particular, there will be a need xiii international monetary fund | april 2010 for some combination of ex ante preventive measures as well as improved ex post resolution mechanisms. resolving the present regulatory unc ertainty will help financial institutions better plan and adapt their business strategies. in moving forward with regulatory reforms to address systemic risks, care will be needed to ensure that the combination of measures strikes the right balance between the safety of the financial system and its innovativeness and efficiency. one way that is being considered to improve the safety of the system is to assign capital charges on the basis of an institution’s contribution to systemic risk. while not necessari ly endorsing its use, chapter 2 presents a methodology to construct such a capital surcharge based on financial institutions’ interconnectedness —essentially charging systemically important institutions for the

reduced capital buffers and uncertainty about the size and distribution of bank losses, combined with normal credit cycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on household borrowing, business investment, and asset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -ment, output growth, and balance sheets. this dynamic has the potential to be more severe than in previous credit cycles, given the degree of securitization and leverage in the financial system. thus, it is now clear that the current turmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, reflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities and weak capital bases, which means its effects are likely to be broader, deeper, and more protracted. macroeconomic policies will have to be the first line of defense containing downside risks to the

-els exposed the financial system to a funding disruption and a breakdown in confidence. chapter 2 investigates in some detail how and why this set of instruments has had such an adverse effect on financial stability. in particular, it examines the implications for financial stabil -ity that arise from the valuation and accounting practices for structured credit products, both at origination and subsequently. the implications for bank balance sheets of the market pricing of assets during times of stress or shallow markets are also discussed. because credit rating agen -xicies continue to play a large role in how these products are structured and valued, the chapter examines how the ratings are produced, finding that improvements in the models that rating agencies use should be considered. aside from uncertainty surrounding their valuation and accounting, the business funding model for structured credit products appears to have been flawed. these instruments were frequently housed and financed in bank-associ -ated off-balance-sheet entities, such as struc -tured investment vehicles (sivs) and conduits. the second part of chapter 2 investigates the business and regulatory incentives in setting up such legal entities and the failure to address their risks in the context of banks’ risk manage -ment systems—that is, the piecemeal perimeter of risk consolidation was evidently too narrow for the risks to be properly assessed. although asset-liability maturity mismatches are a common feature of the banking business, these highly leveraged sivs and conduits took on extreme maturity mismatches. they relied too heavily on wholesale markets for funding, suggesting in turn that adverse incentives and a lack of transparency were complicit in the strains that arose. this also suggests that if risks are allo -cated where they are borne and adequate capi -tal is held against such risks, these entities may be much less viable—at least in their current form—as a business model.chapter\\\\t 3—market\\\\t and\\\\tfunding\\\\tilliquidity:\\\\t when\\\\t private\\\\t risk\\\\t becomes\\\\tpublicas the crisis progressed from a funding problem for sivs and conduits to a widespread reduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk management systems within banks were impli -cated. chapter 3 looks at the nexus between market liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an asset with a small associated price change) and funding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -tion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely fashion). it finds that some new instruments may have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -ity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. empirical work supports the notion that rela -tionships between funding and market liquid -ity, both within the united states and among mature economies, have intensified during the crisis period, whereas prior to the summer of 2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. correlations between several emerging market debt and sovereign prices and u.s. funding markets also show marked increases during the crisis, suggesting such financial markets con -tinue to be highly interconnected during crises. chapter 3 notes that trends in the status of large banks in advanced countries show these banks have less protection against a liquidity event than in the past. the reliance on whole -sale funding and the benign financial environ -ment permitted financial firms to become more complacent about their liquidity risk manage -ment systems and “underinsure” against an adverse liquidity event, depending more heavily on central bank intervention for their liquidity problems. similarly, bank supervisors had been focused on the implementation of basel ii, and the basel committee had only recently begun to re-examine liquidity risk issues. lower liquidity in funding markets has induced unprecedented intervention by central banks to ease strains in the interbank money market. chapter 3 evaluates the success of such efforts, focusing on the actions of the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb), and the bank of england. the ability to provide liquidity to a broad array of counterparties using a relatively diverse collateral pool aided the effectiveness of the ecb’s liquidity operations. the federal reserve had to alter its procedures to provide liquidity to the banks that needed it and to reduce the stigma attached to the use of the more widely available discount window. the term auction facility has worked better, and additional facilities have been established recently to further contain liquidity pressures. chapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the effectiveness of emergency liquidity support and finds that

complications arising from the associated structured credit products. but financial institutions in other coun -tries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to varying degree s—weaknesses in risk management systems and prudential supervision. industrialized countries with inflated house price levels relative to fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -hold balance sheets are also at risk.emerging market countries have been broadly resilient, so far. however, some remain vulner -able to a credit pullback, especially in those cases where domestic credit growth has been fueled from external funding sources and large current account deficits need to be financed. debt markets, particularly for external corporate debt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in advanced countries and costs of funding have risen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -tite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled out if financial conditions worsen.losses stemming from credit deterioration and forced sales, as well as reduced earnings growth, have significantly tested the balance sheets of both banks and nonbank financial executive\\\\t summar yxinstitutions. chapter 1 revisits and extends the analysis of subprime-related losses in the october 2007 gfsr and projects that falling u.s. housing prices and rising delinquencies on mortgage payments could lead to aggregate losses related to the residential mortgage market and related securities of about $565 billion, including the expected deterioration of prime loans. adding other categories of loans origi -nated and securities issued in the united states related to commercial real estate, the consumer credit market, and corporations increases aggre -gate potential losses to about $945 billion. these estimates, while based on imprecise information about exposures and valuation, suggest poten -tial added stress on bank capital and further writedowns. moreover, combined with losses to nonbank financial institutions, including mono -line bond insurers, the danger is that there may be additional reverberations back to the bank -ing system as the deleveraging continues. the risk of litigation over contract performance is also growing. macroeconomic feedback effects are also a growing concern. reduced capital buffers and uncertainty about the size and distribution of bank losses, combined with normal credit cycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on household borrowing, business investment, and asset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -ment, output growth, and balance sheets. this dynamic has the potential to be more severe than in previous credit cycles, given the degree of securitization and leverage in the financial system. thus, it is now clear that the current turmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, reflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities and weak capital bases, which means its effects are likely to be broader, deeper, and more protracted. macroeconomic policies will have to be the first line of defense containing downside risks to the economy, but policymakers need to move on broader fronts. a key challenge is to ensure that large systemically important financial institu -tions continue to move quickly to repair their balance sheets, raising equity and medium-term funding, even if it is more costly to do so now, in order to boost confidence and avoid further undermining the credit channel. equity inflows have already been forthcoming from various investors, including sovereign wealth funds, but more equity infusions will likely be needed to help recapitalize institutions. in addition to forceful monetary easings by a number of major central banks, liquidity has also been provided to money markets at various maturities to ensure their smooth function -ing. these actions, in some cases coordinated across central banks, have been supported by a strengthening of their operational procedures. looking forward, recent developments suggest that central banks need to reflect further on the role that monetary policy may have played in fostering a lack of credit discipline and to improve their instruments for relieving liquidity stress in today’s more global financial system. however, the immediate priority facing poli -cymakers in some mature market countries is to address vulnerabilities to systemic instability in ways that minimize both moral hazard and potential fiscal costs. in addition to an examina -tion of underlying causes, it will be important to address private sector incentives and com -pensation structures so that a similar buildup of vulnerabilities is less likely in the future. chapter\\\\t 2—structured\\\\t finance:\\\\t issues\\\\t of\\\\tvaluation\\\\t and\\\\tdisclosurethe proliferation of new complex structured finance products, markets, and business mod -els exposed the financial system to a funding disruption and a breakdown in confidence. chapter 2 investigates in some detail how and why this set of instruments has had such an adverse effect on financial stability. in particular, it examines the implications for financial stabil -ity that arise from the valuation and accounting practices for structured credit products, both at origination and subsequently. the implications for bank balance sheets of the market pricing of assets during times of stress or shallow markets are also discussed. because credit rating agen -xicies continue to play a large role in how these products are structured and valued, the chapter examines how the ratings are produced, finding that improvements in the models that rating agencies use should be considered. aside from uncertainty surrounding their valuation and accounting, the business funding model for structured credit products appears to have been flawed. these instruments were frequently housed and financed in bank-associ -ated off-balance-sheet entities, such as struc -tured investment vehicles (sivs) and conduits. the second part of chapter 2 investigates the business and regulatory incentives in setting up such legal entities and the failure to address their risks in the context of banks’ risk manage -ment systems—that is, the piecemeal perimeter of risk consolidation was evidently too narrow for the risks to be properly assessed. although asset-liability maturity mismatches are a common feature of the banking business, these highly leveraged sivs and conduits took on extreme maturity mismatches. they relied too heavily on wholesale markets for funding, suggesting in turn that adverse incentives and a lack of transparency were complicit in the strains that arose. this also suggests that if risks are allo -cated where they are borne and adequate capi -tal is held against such risks, these entities may be much less viable—at least in their current form—as a business model.chapter\\\\t 3—market\\\\t and\\\\tfunding\\\\tilliquidity:\\\\t when\\\\t private\\\\t risk\\\\t becomes\\\\tpublicas the crisis progressed from a funding problem for sivs and conduits to a widespread reduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk management systems within banks were impli -cated. chapter 3 looks at the nexus between market liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an asset with a small associated price change) and funding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -tion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely fashion). it finds that some new instruments may have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -ity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. empirical work supports the notion that rela -tionships between funding and market liquid -ity, both within the united states and among mature economies, have intensified during the crisis period, whereas prior to the summer of 2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. correlations between several emerging market debt and sovereign prices and u.s. funding markets also show marked increases during the crisis, suggesting such financial markets con -tinue to be highly interconnected during crises. chapter 3 notes that trends in the status of large banks in advanced countries show these banks have less protection against a liquidity event than in the past. the reliance on whole -sale funding and the benign financial environ -ment permitted financial firms to become more complacent about their liquidity risk manage -ment systems and “underinsure” against an adverse liquidity event, depending more heavily on central bank intervention for their liquidity problems. similarly, bank supervisors had been focused on the implementation of basel ii, and the basel committee had only recently begun to re-examine liquidity risk issues. lower liquidity in funding markets has induced unprecedented intervention by central banks to ease strains in the interbank money market. chapter 3 evaluates the success of such efforts, focusing on the actions of the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb), and the bank of england. the ability to provide liquidity to a broad array of counterparties using a relatively diverse collateral pool aided the effectiveness of the ecb’s liquidity operations. the federal reserve had to alter its procedures to provide liquidity to the banks that needed it and to reduce the stigma attached to the use of the more widely available discount window. the term auction facility has worked better, and additional facilities have been established recently to further contain liquidity pressures. chapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the effectiveness of emergency liquidity support and finds that federal reserve and ecb actions were executive\\\\t summar yxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -ket interest rates, though the impact on spread levels appears to have been small. conclusions\\\\t and\\\\tpolicy\\\\t initiativesalthough the growth and prosperity of recent years gave ample illustration of the benefits of financial innovation, the events of the past eight months have also shown that there are costs. credit risk transfer products—innovations that were meant to disperse risk broadly—were not always used to move risk to those best able to bear it. in fact, a surprising amount of risk has returned to the banking system from where it was allegedly dispersed. even though the gfsr and others warned of higher leverage embed -ded in the new structured credit instruments and higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -cial institutions) now appear to be far more leveraged than most had anticipated. as well, regulation and supervision of these new instru -ments and techniques did not keep pace. what follows are a number of short- and medium-term recommendations relevant to the current episode. several others groups and fora—such as the financial stability forum, the joint forum, the basel committee on banking supervision—are concurrently developing their own detailed standards and guidance, much of which is likely to address practical issues at a deeper level than the recommendations pro -posed below. in the short term... the immediate challenge is to reduce the duration and severity of the crisis. actions that focus on reducing uncertainty and strength -ening confidence in mature market financial systems should be the first priority. some steps can be accomplished by the private sector without the need for formal regulation. others, where the public-good nature of the problem precludes a purely private solution, will require official sector involvement.areas in which the private sector could use -fully contribute are:• disclosure. providing timely and consistent reporting of exposures and valuation meth -ods to the public, particularly for structured credit products and other illiquid assets, will help alleviate uncertainties about regulated financial institutions’ positions. • bank balance sheet repair. writedowns, undertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of their size can be established, will help cleanse banks’ balance sheets. weakly capitalized insti -tutions should immediately seek to raise fresh equity and medium-term funding even if the cost of doing so appears high. • overall risk management. institutions could usefully disclose broad strategies that aim to correct the risk management failings that may have contributed to losses and liquidity difficulties. governance structures and the integration of the management of different types of risk across the institution need to be improved. counterparty risk management has also resurfaced as an issue to address. a re-examination of the progress made over the last decade and gaps that are still present (perhaps inadequate information or risk man -agement structures) will need to be closed. • managerial compensation structures. incen -tives that may act to shorten the horizon of top management of deposit-taking financial institutions need corrective action. ideally, compensation at such regulated financial institutions should provide incentives to cor -rect risk management failings early, provide for adequate capital and liquidity buffers, and generally take decisions that enhance the long-run viability of the firm so as to lessen systemic risks.short-term official sector actions would be most helpful in the following areas:• consistency of treatment. along with audi -tors, supervisors can encourage transparency and ensure the consistency of approach for difficult-to-value securities so that account -ing and valuation discrepancies across global financial institutions are minimized. supervi -sors should be able to evaluate the robustness of the models used by regulated entities to ixixexecutive\\\\t summar ythe events of the past six months have demonstrated the fragility of the global financial system and raised fundamental questions about the effectiveness of the response by private and public sector institu -tions. while events are still unfolding, the april 2008 global financial stability report (gfsr) assesses the vulnerabilities that the system is fac -ing and offers tentative conclusions and policy lessons. some key themes that emerge from this analysis include:• there was a collective failure to appreciate the extent of leverage taken on by a wide range of institutions—banks, monoline insur -ers, government-sponsored entities, hedge funds—and the associated risks of a disorderly unwinding.• private sector risk management, disclosure, financial sector supervision, and regulation all lagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts in business models, leaving scope for exces -sive risk-taking, weak underwriting, maturity mismatches, and asset price inflation.• the transfer of risks off bank balance sheets was overestimated. as risks have materialized, this has placed enormous pressures back on the balance sheets of banks.• notwithstanding unprecedented interven -tion by major central banks, financial mar -kets remain under considerable strain, now compounded by a more worrisome macroeco -nomic environment, weakly capitalized institu -tions, and broad-based deleveraging.in sum, the global financial system has undoubtedly come under increasing strains since the october 2007 gfsr, and risks to financial stability remain elevated. the systemic concerns are exacerbated by a deterioration of credit quality, a drop in valuations of structured credit products, and a lack of market liquid -ity accompanying a broad deleveraging in the financial system. the critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps to mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching adjustment, including by preparing contingency and other remediation plans, while also address -ing the seeds of the present turmoil.chapter\\\\t 1—assessing\\\\t risks\\\\t to\\\\tglobal\\\\tfinancial\\\\t stabilitychapter 1

across global financial institutions are minimized. supervi -sors should be able to evaluate the robustness of the models used by regulated entities to xiiivalue securities. some latitude in the strict application of fair value accounting during stressful events may need to be more formally recognized.• more intense supervision. supervisors will need to better assess capital adequacy related to risks that may not be covered in pillar 1 of the basel ii framework. more attention could be paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -priate risk management system (including for market and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -nal governance structure. when supervisors are not satisfied that risk is being appropri -ately managed or that adequate contingency plans are in place, they should be able to insist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.• special stability reports. to help reduce uncertainty and correct negative public misperceptions, especially in the current context of illiquid, hard-to-value structured credit securities, special stability reports could be helpful. such reports could usefully draw on relevant supervisory information, assess current risks objectively, and highlight plans to address vulnerabilities in the countries involved. • early action to resolve troubled institutions. the public sector should proactively stand ready to promptly address stress within troubled financial institutions. in such cases, early remedial action or intervention may be warranted.• public plans for impaired assets. national authorities may wish to prepare contingency plans for dealing with large stocks of impaired assets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -ics and significant negative effects on the real economy. the modalities of doing so will dif -fer across countries and sectors, but success -ful instances in which fire sales of impaired assets have been prevented could usefully be emulated.for emerging market countries, policy actions should focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the knock-on effects from mature markets. specifi -cally, banks in countries experiencing rapid credit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency plans to address reductions in such funding. countries that have relied on external fund -ing should expect to see domestic pressures develop if international liquidity becomes scarce. financial market supervisors in locations where housing prices have experienced run-ups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures would be handled and whether the legal setting is conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. nearly all emerging market countries should review the reliability and depth of detail in financial institutions’ public disclosures and the robustness of their accounting frameworks as uncertainty about the health of major financial institutions breeds financial instability. emerg -ing market supervisors, regulators, and central banks should review their own contingency plans—particularly those related to managing liquidity disruptions. steps should be taken with home supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate such plans and ongoing supervision.in the medium term... more fundamental changes are needed over the medium term. policymakers should avoid a “rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly stifle innovation or that could exacerbate the effects of the current credit squeeze. moreover, the basel ii capital accord, if implemented rigorously, already provides scope for improve -ments in the banking area. nonetheless, there are areas that need further scrutiny, especially as regards structured products and treatment of off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further adjustments to frameworks are needed. given their role in the crisis, structured finance and the originate-to-distribute business model of securitization require a careful exami -nation of what needs to be fixed. it is important to note that securitization, per se, was not the problem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -ing standards in the u.s. mortgage market, the concomitant extension of securitization into increasingly complex and difficult-to-understand structures, collateralized by increasingly lower quality assets, and a favorable financial environ - ixixexecutive\\\\t summar ythe events of the past six months have

uncertainty surrounding their valuation and accounting, the business funding model for structured credit products appears to have been flawed. these instruments were frequently housed and financed in bank-associ -ated off-balance-sheet entities, such as struc -tured investment vehicles (sivs) and conduits. the second part of chapter 2 investigates the business and regulatory incentives in setting up such legal entities and the failure to address their risks in the context of banks’ risk manage -ment systems—that is, the piecemeal perimeter of risk consolidation was evidently too narrow for the risks to be properly assessed. although asset-liability maturity mismatches are a common feature of the banking business, these highly leveraged sivs and conduits took on extreme maturity mismatches. they relied too heavily on wholesale markets for funding, suggesting in turn that adverse incentives and a lack of transparency were complicit in the strains that arose. this also suggests that if risks are allo -cated where they are borne and adequate capi -tal is held against such risks, these entities may be much less viable—at least in their current form—as a business model.chapter\\\\t 3—market\\\\t and\\\\tfunding\\\\tilliquidity:\\\\t when\\\\t private\\\\t risk\\\\t becomes\\\\tpublicas the crisis progressed from a funding problem for sivs and conduits to a widespread reduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk management systems within banks were impli -cated. chapter 3 looks at the nexus between market liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an asset with a small associated price change) and funding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -tion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely fashion). it finds that some new instruments may have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -ity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. empirical work supports the notion that rela -tionships between funding and market liquid -ity, both within the united states and among mature economies, have intensified during the crisis period, whereas prior to the summer of 2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. correlations between several emerging market debt and sovereign prices and u.s. funding markets also show marked increases during the crisis, suggesting such financial markets con -tinue to be highly interconnected during crises. chapter 3 notes that trends in the status of large banks in advanced countries show these banks have less protection against a liquidity event than in the past. the reliance on whole -sale funding and the benign financial environ -ment permitted financial firms to become more complacent about their liquidity risk manage -ment systems and “underinsure” against an adverse liquidity event, depending more heavily on central bank intervention for their liquidity problems. similarly, bank supervisors had been focused on the implementation of basel ii, and the basel committee had only recently begun to re-examine liquidity risk issues. lower liquidity in funding markets has induced unprecedented intervention by central banks to ease strains in the interbank money market. chapter 3 evaluates the success of such efforts, focusing on the actions of the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb), and the bank of england. the ability to provide liquidity to a broad array of counterparties using a relatively diverse collateral pool aided the effectiveness of the ecb’s liquidity operations. the federal reserve had to alter its procedures to provide liquidity to the banks that needed it and to reduce the stigma attached to the use of the more widely available discount window. the term auction facility has worked better, and additional facilities have been established recently to further contain liquidity pressures. chapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the effectiveness of emergency liquidity support and finds that federal reserve and ecb actions were executive\\\\t summar yxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -ket interest rates, though the impact on spread levels appears to have been small. conclusions\\\\t and\\\\tpolicy\\\\t initiativesalthough the growth and prosperity of recent years gave ample illustration of the benefits of financial innovation, the events of the past eight months have also shown that there are costs. credit risk transfer products—innovations that were meant to disperse risk broadly—were not always used to move risk to those best able to bear it. in fact, a surprising amount of risk has returned to the banking system from where it was allegedly dispersed. even though the gfsr and others warned of higher leverage embed -ded in the new structured credit instruments and higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -cial institutions) now appear to be far more leveraged than most had anticipated. as well, regulation and supervision of these new instru -ments and techniques did not keep pace. what follows are a number of short- and medium-term recommendations relevant to the current episode. several others groups and fora—such as the financial stability forum, the joint forum, the basel committee on banking supervision—are concurrently developing their own detailed standards and guidance, much of which is likely to address practical issues at a deeper level than the recommendations pro -posed below. in the short term... the immediate challenge is to reduce the duration and severity of the crisis. actions that focus on reducing uncertainty and strength -ening confidence in mature market financial systems should be the first priority. some steps can be accomplished by the private sector without the need for formal regulation. others, where the public-good nature of the problem precludes a purely private solution, will require official sector involvement.areas in which the private sector could use -fully contribute are:• disclosure. providing timely and consistent reporting of exposures and valuation meth -ods to the public, particularly for structured credit products and other illiquid assets, will help alleviate uncertainties about regulated financial institutions’ positions. • bank balance sheet repair. writedowns, undertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of their size can be established, will help cleanse banks’ balance sheets. weakly capitalized insti -tutions should immediately seek to raise fresh equity and medium-term funding even if the cost of doing so appears high. • overall risk management. institutions could usefully disclose broad strategies that aim to correct the risk management failings that may have contributed to losses and liquidity difficulties. governance structures and the integration of the management of different types of risk across the institution need to be improved. counterparty risk management has also resurfaced as an issue to address. a re-examination of the progress made over the last decade and gaps that are still present (perhaps inadequate information or risk man -agement structures) will need to be closed. • managerial compensation structures. incen -tives that may act to shorten the horizon of top management of deposit-taking financial institutions need corrective action. ideally, compensation at such regulated financial institutions should provide incentives to cor -rect risk management failings early, provide for adequate capital and liquidity buffers, and generally take decisions that enhance the long-run viability of the firm so as to lessen systemic risks.short-term official sector actions would be most helpful in the following areas:• consistency of treatment. along with audi -tors, supervisors can encourage transparency and ensure the consistency of approach for difficult-to-value securities so that account -ing and valuation discrepancies across global financial institutions are minimized. supervi -sors should be able to evaluate the robustness of the models used by regulated entities to xiiivalue securities. some latitude in the strict application of fair value accounting during stressful events may need to be more formally recognized.• more intense supervision. supervisors will need to better assess capital adequacy related to risks that may not be covered in pillar 1 of the basel ii framework. more attention could be paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -priate risk management system (including for market and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -nal governance structure. when supervisors are not satisfied that risk is being appropri -ately managed or that adequate contingency plans are in place, they should be able to insist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.• special stability reports. to help reduce uncertainty and correct negative public misperceptions, especially in the current context of illiquid, hard-to-value structured credit securities, special stability reports could be helpful. such reports could usefully draw on relevant supervisory information, assess current risks objectively, and highlight plans to address vulnerabilities in the countries involved. • early action to resolve troubled institutions. the public sector should proactively stand ready to promptly address stress within troubled financial institutions. in such cases, early remedial action or intervention may be warranted.• public plans for impaired assets. national authorities may wish to prepare contingency plans for dealing with large stocks of impaired assets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -ics and significant negative effects on the real economy. the modalities of doing so will dif -fer across countries and sectors, but success -ful instances in which fire sales of impaired assets have been prevented could usefully be emulated.for emerging market countries, policy actions should focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the knock-on effects from mature markets. specifi -cally, banks in countries experiencing rapid credit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency plans to address reductions in such funding. countries that have relied on external fund -ing should expect to see domestic pressures develop if international liquidity becomes scarce. financial market supervisors in locations where housing prices have experienced run-ups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures would be handled and whether the legal setting is conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. nearly all emerging market countries should review the reliability and depth of detail in financial institutions’ public disclosures and the robustness of their accounting frameworks as uncertainty about the health of major financial institutions breeds financial instability. emerg -ing market supervisors, regulators, and central banks should review their own contingency plans—particularly those related to managing liquidity disruptions. steps should be taken with home supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate such plans and ongoing supervision.in the medium term... more fundamental changes are needed over the medium term. policymakers should avoid a “rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly stifle innovation or that could exacerbate the effects of the current credit squeeze. moreover, the basel ii capital accord, if implemented rigorously, already provides scope for improve -ments in the banking area. nonetheless, there are areas that need further scrutiny, especially as regards structured products and treatment of off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further adjustments to frameworks are needed. given their role in the crisis, structured finance and the originate-to-distribute business model of securitization require a careful exami -nation of what needs to be fixed. it is important to note that securitization, per se, was not the problem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -ing standards in the u.s. mortgage market, the concomitant extension of securitization into increasingly complex and difficult-to-understand structures, collateralized by increasingly lower quality assets, and a favorable financial environ -executive\\\\t summar yxivment in which risks were insufficiently appre -ciated. in retrospect, not enough capital was allocated to cover these risks. although chap -ter 2 does not attempt an exhaustive analysis of the adverse incentives that led to the extreme growth in structured finance underpinning the crisis, some tentative policies can be put forward.the private sector could usefully move in the following directions: • standardization of some components of structured finance products. this could help increase market participants’ understand -ing of risks, facilitate the development of a secondary market with more liquidity, and help the comparability of valuation. standard -ization could also facilitate the development of a clearinghouse that would mutualize coun -terparty risks associated with these types of over-the-counter products. • transparency at origination and subsequently. investors will be better able to assess the risk of securitized products if they receive more timely, comprehensible, and adequate infor -mation about the underlying assets and the sensitivity of valuation to various assumptions. • reform of rating systems. a differentiated rating scale for structured credit products was recommended in the april 2006 gfsr. also, additional information on the vulnerability of structured credit products to downgrades would need to accompany the new scale for it to be meaningful. this step may require a re-assessment of the regulatory and supervisory treatment of rated securities. • transparency and disclosure. originators should disclose to their investors relevant aggregate information on key risks in off- balance-sheet entities on a timely and regular basis. these should include the reliance by institutions on credit risk mitigation instru -ments such as insurance, and the degree to which the risks reside with the sponsor, particularly in cases of distress. more gener -ally, convergence of disclosure practices (e.g., timing and content) internationally should be considered by standard setters and regulators.the official sector should examine the fol -lowing areas where the application of various standards may have systemic consequences. • greater attention to applying fair value accounting results. the prospects of forced sales triggered by fair value below some threshold will need to be examined thor -oughly. ways of guiding firms to review the elements underlying the valuation without being forced to sell would be helpful. the extent to which such fair value “triggers” are either encouraged or mandated in regulation and supervisory guidance would need to be re-evaluated. it is the role of prudential super -vision to judge the reliability of various meth -ods used to establish fair values, especially when a marked-to-model approach is used. accounting standard setters will increasingly need to take into account the financial stabil -ity implications in their accounting practices and guidance.• incentives to set up sivs and conduits. in principle, basel ii provides less incentive than basel i to transfer risks to such entities for the purpose of lowering regulatory capital charges. nonetheless, a strict implementation of basel ii by national supervisors, possibly armed with stronger guidance regarding conditions for risk transfer and appropriate capital relief, will be needed. accounting stan -dards setters, in cooperation with supervisors, should revisit consolidation rules to address incentives that may encourage a lack of trans -parency regarding off-balance-sheet activities and risks. • tighten oversight of mortgage originators. in the united states, broadening 2006 and 2007 bank guidance notes on good lending practices to cover nonbank mortgage origi -nators should be considered. the efficiency of coordination across banking regulators would also be enhanced if the fragmentation across the various regulatory bodies were addressed. consideration could be given to devising mechanisms that would leave origi -nators with a financial stake in the loans they originate. ixixexecutive\\\\t summar ythe events of the past six months have demonstrated the fragility of the global financial system and raised fundamental questions about the effectiveness of the response by private and public sector institu -tions. while events are still unfolding, the april 2008 global financial stability report (gfsr) assesses the vulnerabilities that the system is fac -ing and offers tentative conclusions and policy lessons. some key themes that emerge from this analysis include:• there was a collective failure to appreciate the extent of leverage taken on by a wide range of institutions—banks, monoline insur -ers, government-sponsored entities, hedge funds—and the associated risks of a disorderly unwinding.• private sector risk management, disclosure, financial sector supervision, and regulation all lagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts in business models, leaving scope for exces -sive risk-taking, weak underwriting, maturity mismatches, and asset price inflation.• the transfer of risks off bank balance sheets was overestimated. as risks have materialized, this has placed enormous pressures back on the balance sheets of banks.• notwithstanding unprecedented interven -tion by major central banks, financial mar -kets remain under considerable strain, now compounded by a more worrisome macroeco -nomic environment, weakly capitalized institu -tions, and broad-based deleveraging.in sum, the global financial system has undoubtedly come under increasing strains since the october 2007 gfsr, and risks to financial stability remain elevated. the systemic concerns are exacerbated by a deterioration of credit quality, a drop in valuations of structured credit products, and a lack of market liquid -ity accompanying a broad deleveraging in the financial system. the critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps to mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching adjustment, including by preparing contingency and other remediation plans, while also address -ing the seeds of the present turmoil.chapter\\\\t 1—assessing\\\\t risks\\\\t to\\\\tglobal\\\\tfinancial\\\\t stabilitychapter 1 documents how the crisis is spread -ing beyond the u.s. subprime market—namely to the prime residential and commercial real estate markets, consumer credit, and the low- to high-grade corporate credit markets. the united states remains the epicenter, as the u.s. subprime mar -ket was the origin of weakened credit standards and was the first to experience the complications arising from the associated structured credit products. but financial institutions in other coun -tries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to varying degree s—weaknesses in risk management systems and prudential supervision. industrialized countries with inflated house price levels relative to fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -hold balance sheets are also at risk.emerging market countries have been broadly resilient, so far. however, some remain vulner -able to a credit pullback, especially in those cases where domestic credit growth has been fueled from external funding sources and large current account deficits need to be financed. debt markets, particularly for external corporate debt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in advanced countries and costs of funding have risen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -tite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled out if financial conditions worsen.losses stemming from credit deterioration and forced sales, as well as reduced earnings growth, have significantly tested the balance sheets of both banks and nonbank financial executive\\\\t summar yxinstitutions. chapter 1 revisits and extends the analysis of subprime-related losses in the october 2007 gfsr and projects that falling u.s. housing prices and rising delinquencies on mortgage payments could lead to aggregate losses related to the residential mortgage market and related securities of about $565 billion, including the expected deterioration of prime loans. adding other categories of loans origi -nated and securities issued in the united states related to commercial real estate, the consumer credit market, and corporations increases aggre -gate potential losses to about $945 billion. these estimates, while based on imprecise information about exposures and valuation, suggest poten -tial added stress on bank capital and further writedowns. moreover, combined with losses to nonbank financial institutions, including mono -line bond insurers, the danger is that there may be additional reverberations back to the bank -ing system as the deleveraging continues. the risk of litigation over contract performance is also growing. macroeconomic feedback effects are also a growing concern. reduced capital buffers and uncertainty about the size and distribution of bank losses, combined with normal credit cycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on household borrowing, business investment, and asset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -ment, output growth, and balance sheets. this dynamic has the potential to be more severe than in previous credit cycles, given the degree of securitization and leverage in the financial system. thus, it is now clear that the current turmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, reflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities and weak capital bases, which means its effects are likely to be broader, deeper, and more protracted. macroeconomic policies will have to be the first line of defense containing downside risks to the economy, but policymakers need to move on broader fronts. a key challenge is to ensure that large systemically important financial institu -tions continue to move quickly to repair their balance sheets, raising equity and medium-term funding, even if it is more costly to do so now, in order to boost confidence and avoid further undermining the credit channel. equity inflows have already been forthcoming from various investors, including sovereign wealth funds, but more equity infusions will likely be needed to help recapitalize institutions. in addition to forceful monetary easings by a number of major central banks, liquidity has also been provided to money markets at various maturities to ensure their smooth function -ing. these actions, in some cases coordinated across central banks, have been supported by a strengthening of their operational procedures. looking forward, recent developments suggest that central banks need to reflect further on the role that monetary policy may have played in fostering a lack of credit discipline and to improve their instruments for relieving liquidity stress in today’s more global financial system. however, the immediate priority facing poli -cymakers in some mature market countries is to address vulnerabilities to systemic instability in ways that minimize both moral hazard and potential fiscal costs. in addition to an examina -tion of underlying causes, it will be important to address private sector incentives and com -pensation structures so that a similar buildup of vulnerabilities is less likely in the future. chapter\\\\t 2—structured\\\\t finance:\\\\t issues\\\\t of\\\\tvaluation\\\\t and\\\\tdisclosurethe proliferation of new complex structured finance products, markets, and business mod -els exposed the financial system to a funding disruption and a breakdown in confidence. chapter 2 investigates in some detail how and why this set of instruments has had such an adverse effect on financial stability. in particular, it examines the implications for financial stabil -ity that arise from the valuation and accounting practices for structured credit products, both at origination and subsequently. the implications for bank balance sheets of the market pricing of assets during times of stress or shallow markets are also discussed. because credit rating agen -xicies continue to play a large role in how these products are structured and valued, the chapter examines how the ratings are produced, finding that improvements in the models that rating agencies use should be considered. aside from

consideration could be given to devising mechanisms that would leave origi -nators with a financial stake in the loans they originate. xvanother area in which weaknesses contrib -uted to the crisis is financial institutions’ liquid -ity management. it is now obvious that various factors may have encouraged financial institu -tions to insufficiently protect themselves against an adverse liquidity event—a situation that needs to be addressed.for financial institutions, the crisis has pro -vided many important lessons including those involving:• liquidity risk management. firms will need to factor in more severe price jumps (“gapping”) and correlation movements in their market risk models, employing adjustments to risk measures where possible. better stress tests could be undertaken with longer periods of funding illiquidity and improved contingency plans. more transparency regarding how liquidity risk is managed within the firm could be available to investors.• more realistic assumptions about the liquidity of complex structured securities. firms’ reli -ance on highly structured securities to gener -ate collateral proved problematic during the crisis. greater availability on balance sheets of highly liquid assets to use as collateral could allow institutions easier access to funding sources during periods of stress.financial regulators and supervisory authori -ties also need to take a more active role in reviewing liquidity management issues and supervisory guidance, and considering other regulatory improvements.• strengthen existing international liquidity guidance. the basel committee’s working group on liquidity is already considering how to strengthen its existing guidance in this area, and prompt review would be welcome. the use of multiple currencies for funding globally active banks suggests that a more uni -fied approach to liquidity management across countries may be needed. • monitoring best practices. a better method of monitoring progress toward achieving “best practices” for liquidity management (e.g., those of the basel committee, the joint forum, and the institute of international finance) could help prevent gaps across institutions. if progress is insufficient, a pillar 2-like system may be needed, whereby supervisors are tasked with ensuring that adequate bank liquidity management systems are in place and that

ixixexecutive\\\\t summar ythe events of the past six months have demonstrated the fragility of the global financial system and raised fundamental questions about the effectiveness of the response by private and public sector institu -tions. while events are still unfolding, the april 2008 global financial stability report (gfsr) assesses the vulnerabilities that the system is fac -ing and offers tentative conclusions and policy lessons. some key themes that emerge from this analysis include:• there was a collective failure to appreciate the extent of leverage taken on by a wide range of institutions—banks, monoline insur -ers, government-sponsored entities, hedge funds—and the associated risks of a disorderly unwinding.• private sector risk management, disclosure, financial sector supervision, and regulation all lagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts in business models, leaving scope for exces -sive risk-taking, weak underwriting, maturity mismatches, and asset price inflation.• the transfer of risks off bank balance sheets was overestimated. as risks have materialized, this has placed enormous pressures back on the balance sheets of banks.• notwithstanding unprecedented interven -tion by major central banks, financial mar -kets remain under considerable strain, now compounded by a more worrisome macroeco -nomic environment, weakly capitalized institu -tions, and broad-based deleveraging.in sum, the global financial system has undoubtedly come under increasing strains since the october 2007 gfsr, and risks to financial stability remain elevated. the systemic concerns are exacerbated by a deterioration of credit quality, a drop in valuations of structured credit products, and a lack of market liquid -ity accompanying a broad deleveraging in the financial system. the critical challenge now facing policymakers is to take immediate steps to mitigate the risks of an even more wrenching adjustment, including by preparing contingency and other remediation plans, while also address -ing the seeds of the present turmoil.chapter\\\\t 1—assessing\\\\t risks\\\\t to\\\\tglobal\\\\tfinancial\\\\t stabilitychapter 1 documents how the crisis is spread -ing beyond the u.s. subprime market—namely to the prime residential and commercial real estate markets, consumer credit, and the low- to high-grade corporate credit markets. the united states remains the epicenter, as the u.s. subprime mar -ket was the origin of weakened credit standards and was the first to experience the complications arising from the associated structured credit products. but financial institutions in other coun -tries have also been affected, reflecting the same overly benign global financial conditions an d—to varying degree s—weaknesses in risk management systems and prudential supervision. industrialized countries with inflated house price levels relative to fundamentals or stretched corporate or house -hold balance sheets are also at risk.emerging market countries have been broadly resilient, so far. however, some remain vulner -able to a credit pullback, especially in those cases where domestic credit growth has been fueled from external funding sources and large current account deficits need to be financed. debt markets, particularly for external corporate debt, have felt the impact of the turbulence in advanced countries and costs of funding have risen and further shocks to investors’ risk appe -tite for emerging market assets cannot be ruled out if financial conditions worsen.losses stemming from credit deterioration and forced sales, as well as reduced earnings growth, have significantly tested the balance sheets of both banks and nonbank financial executive\\\\t summar yxinstitutions. chapter 1 revisits and extends the analysis of subprime-related losses in the october 2007 gfsr and projects that falling u.s. housing prices and rising delinquencies on mortgage payments could lead to aggregate losses related to the residential mortgage market and related securities of about $565 billion, including the expected deterioration of prime loans. adding other categories of loans origi -nated and securities issued in the united states related to commercial real estate, the consumer credit market, and corporations increases aggre -gate potential losses to about $945 billion. these estimates, while based on imprecise information about exposures and valuation, suggest poten -tial added stress on bank capital and further writedowns. moreover, combined with losses to nonbank financial institutions, including mono -line bond insurers, the danger is that there may be additional reverberations back to the bank -ing system as the deleveraging continues. the risk of litigation over contract performance is also growing. macroeconomic feedback effects are also a growing concern. reduced capital buffers and uncertainty about the size and distribution of bank losses, combined with normal credit cycle dynamics, are likely to weigh heavily on household borrowing, business investment, and asset prices, in turn feeding back onto employ -ment, output growth, and balance sheets. this dynamic has the potential to be more severe than in previous credit cycles, given the degree of securitization and leverage in the financial system. thus, it is now clear that the current turmoil is more than simply a liquidity event, reflecting deep-seated balance sheet fragilities and weak capital bases, which means its effects are likely to be broader, deeper, and more protracted. macroeconomic policies will have to be the first line of defense containing downside risks to the economy, but policymakers need to move on broader fronts. a key challenge is to ensure that large systemically important financial institu -tions continue to move quickly to repair their balance sheets, raising equity and medium-term funding, even if it is more costly to do so now, in order to boost confidence and avoid further undermining the credit channel. equity inflows have already been forthcoming from various investors, including sovereign wealth funds, but more equity infusions will likely be needed to help recapitalize institutions. in addition to forceful monetary easings by a number of major central banks, liquidity has also been provided to money markets at various maturities to ensure their smooth function -ing. these actions, in some cases coordinated across central banks, have been supported by a strengthening of their operational procedures. looking forward, recent developments suggest that central banks need to reflect further on the role that monetary policy may have played in fostering a lack of credit discipline and to improve their instruments for relieving liquidity stress in today’s more global financial system. however, the immediate priority facing poli -cymakers in some mature market countries is to address vulnerabilities to systemic instability in ways that minimize both moral hazard and potential fiscal costs. in addition to an examina -tion of underlying causes, it will be important to address private sector incentives and com -pensation structures so that a similar buildup of vulnerabilities is less likely in the future. chapter\\\\t 2—structured\\\\t finance:\\\\t issues\\\\t of\\\\tvaluation\\\\t and\\\\tdisclosurethe proliferation of new complex structured finance products, markets, and business mod -els exposed the financial system to a funding disruption and a breakdown in confidence. chapter 2 investigates in some detail how and why this set of instruments has had such an adverse effect on financial stability. in particular, it examines the implications for financial stabil -ity that arise from the valuation and accounting practices for structured credit products, both at origination and subsequently. the implications for bank balance sheets of the market pricing of assets during times of stress or shallow markets are also discussed. because credit rating agen -xicies continue to play a large role in how these products are structured and valued, the chapter examines how the ratings are produced, finding that improvements in the models that rating agencies use should be considered. aside from uncertainty surrounding their valuation and accounting, the business funding model for structured credit products appears to have been flawed. these instruments were frequently housed and financed in bank-associ -ated off-balance-sheet entities, such as struc -tured investment vehicles (sivs) and conduits. the second part of chapter 2 investigates the business and regulatory incentives in setting up such legal entities and the failure to address their risks in the context of banks’ risk manage -ment systems—that is, the piecemeal perimeter of risk consolidation was evidently too narrow for the risks to be properly assessed. although asset-liability maturity mismatches are a common feature of the banking business, these highly leveraged sivs and conduits took on extreme maturity mismatches. they relied too heavily on wholesale markets for funding, suggesting in turn that adverse incentives and a lack of transparency were complicit in the strains that arose. this also suggests that if risks are allo -cated where they are borne and adequate capi -tal is held against such risks, these entities may be much less viable—at least in their current form—as a business model.chapter\\\\t 3—market\\\\t and\\\\tfunding\\\\tilliquidity:\\\\t when\\\\t private\\\\t risk\\\\t becomes\\\\tpublicas the crisis progressed from a funding problem for sivs and conduits to a widespread reduction in interbank liquidity, liquidity risk management systems within banks were impli -cated. chapter 3 looks at the nexus between market liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an asset with a small associated price change) and funding liquidity (the ability of a solvent institu -tion to make agreed-upon payments in a timely fashion). it finds that some new instruments may have increased the potential for adverse “liquidity spirals” in which market illiquid -ity leads to funding illiquidity and vice versa. empirical work supports the notion that rela -tionships between funding and market liquid -ity, both within the united states and among mature economies, have intensified during the crisis period, whereas prior to the summer of 2007 such linkages were practically nonexistent. correlations between several emerging market debt and sovereign prices and u.s. funding markets also show marked increases during the crisis, suggesting such financial markets con -tinue to be highly interconnected during crises. chapter 3 notes that trends in the status of large banks in advanced countries show these banks have less protection against a liquidity event than in the past. the reliance on whole -sale funding and the benign financial environ -ment permitted financial firms to become more complacent about their liquidity risk manage -ment systems and “underinsure” against an adverse liquidity event, depending more heavily on central bank intervention for their liquidity problems. similarly, bank supervisors had been focused on the implementation of basel ii, and the basel committee had only recently begun to re-examine liquidity risk issues. lower liquidity in funding markets has induced unprecedented intervention by central banks to ease strains in the interbank money market. chapter 3 evaluates the success of such efforts, focusing on the actions of the federal reserve, the european central bank (ecb), and the bank of england. the ability to provide liquidity to a broad array of counterparties using a relatively diverse collateral pool aided the effectiveness of the ecb’s liquidity operations. the federal reserve had to alter its procedures to provide liquidity to the banks that needed it and to reduce the stigma attached to the use of the more widely available discount window. the term auction facility has worked better, and additional facilities have been established recently to further contain liquidity pressures. chapter 3 attempts to empirically gauge the effectiveness of emergency liquidity support and finds that federal reserve and ecb actions were executive\\\\t summar yxiihelpful in reducing the volatility of money mar -ket interest rates, though the impact on spread levels appears to have been small. conclusions\\\\t and\\\\tpolicy\\\\t initiativesalthough the growth and prosperity of recent years gave ample illustration of the benefits of financial innovation, the events of the past eight months have also shown that there are costs. credit risk transfer products—innovations that were meant to disperse risk broadly—were not always used to move risk to those best able to bear it. in fact, a surprising amount of risk has returned to the banking system from where it was allegedly dispersed. even though the gfsr and others warned of higher leverage embed -ded in the new structured credit instruments and higher risk-taking, banks (and other finan -cial institutions) now appear to be far more leveraged than most had anticipated. as well, regulation and supervision of these new instru -ments and techniques did not keep pace. what follows are a number of short- and medium-term recommendations relevant to the current episode. several others groups and fora—such as the financial stability forum, the joint forum, the basel committee on banking supervision—are concurrently developing their own detailed standards and guidance, much of which is likely to address practical issues at a deeper level than the recommendations pro -posed below. in the short term... the immediate challenge is to reduce the duration and severity of the crisis. actions that focus on reducing uncertainty and strength -ening confidence in mature market financial systems should be the first priority. some steps can be accomplished by the private sector without the need for formal regulation. others, where the public-good nature of the problem precludes a purely private solution, will require official sector involvement.areas in which the private sector could use -fully contribute are:• disclosure. providing timely and consistent reporting of exposures and valuation meth -ods to the public, particularly for structured credit products and other illiquid assets, will help alleviate uncertainties about regulated financial institutions’ positions. • bank balance sheet repair. writedowns, undertaken as soon as reasonable estimates of their size can be established, will help cleanse banks’ balance sheets. weakly capitalized insti -tutions should immediately seek to raise fresh equity and medium-term funding even if the cost of doing so appears high. • overall risk management. institutions could usefully disclose broad strategies that aim to correct the risk management failings that may have contributed to losses and liquidity difficulties. governance structures and the integration of the management of different types of risk across the institution need to be improved. counterparty risk management has also resurfaced as an issue to address. a re-examination of the progress made over the last decade and gaps that are still present (perhaps inadequate information or risk man -agement structures) will need to be closed. • managerial compensation structures. incen -tives that may act to shorten the horizon of top management of deposit-taking financial institutions need corrective action. ideally, compensation at such regulated financial institutions should provide incentives to cor -rect risk management failings early, provide for adequate capital and liquidity buffers, and generally take decisions that enhance the long-run viability of the firm so as to lessen systemic risks.short-term official sector actions would be most helpful in the following areas:• consistency of treatment. along with audi -tors, supervisors can encourage transparency and ensure the consistency of approach for difficult-to-value securities so that account -ing and valuation discrepancies across global financial institutions are minimized. supervi -sors should be able to evaluate the robustness of the models used by regulated entities to xiiivalue securities. some latitude in the strict application of fair value accounting during stressful events may need to be more formally recognized.• more intense supervision. supervisors will need to better assess capital adequacy related to risks that may not be covered in pillar 1 of the basel ii framework. more attention could be paid to ensuring that banks have an appro -priate risk management system (including for market and liquidity risks) and a strong inter -nal governance structure. when supervisors are not satisfied that risk is being appropri -ately managed or that adequate contingency plans are in place, they should be able to insist on greater capital and liquidity buffers.• special stability reports. to help reduce uncertainty and correct negative public misperceptions, especially in the current context of illiquid, hard-to-value structured credit securities, special stability reports could be helpful. such reports could usefully draw on relevant supervisory information, assess current risks objectively, and highlight plans to address vulnerabilities in the countries involved. • early action to resolve troubled institutions. the public sector should proactively stand ready to promptly address stress within troubled financial institutions. in such cases, early remedial action or intervention may be warranted.• public plans for impaired assets. national authorities may wish to prepare contingency plans for dealing with large stocks of impaired assets if writedowns lead to disruptive dynam -ics and significant negative effects on the real economy. the modalities of doing so will dif -fer across countries and sectors, but success -ful instances in which fire sales of impaired assets have been prevented could usefully be emulated.for emerging market countries, policy actions should focus on lowering vulnerabilities to the knock-on effects from mature markets. specifi -cally, banks in countries experiencing rapid credit growth funded by external sources will need to develop robust and realistic contingency plans to address reductions in such funding. countries that have relied on external fund -ing should expect to see domestic pressures develop if international liquidity becomes scarce. financial market supervisors in locations where housing prices have experienced run-ups could usefully re-examine how foreclosures would be handled and whether the legal setting is conducive to a smooth unwinding of excesses. nearly all emerging market countries should review the reliability and depth of detail in financial institutions’ public disclosures and the robustness of their accounting frameworks as uncertainty about the health of major financial institutions breeds financial instability. emerg -ing market supervisors, regulators, and central banks should review their own contingency plans—particularly those related to managing liquidity disruptions. steps should be taken with home supervisors of foreign banks to coordinate such plans and ongoing supervision.in the medium term... more fundamental changes are needed over the medium term. policymakers should avoid a “rush to regulate,” especially in ways that unduly stifle innovation or that could exacerbate the effects of the current credit squeeze. moreover, the basel ii capital accord, if implemented rigorously, already provides scope for improve -ments in the banking area. nonetheless, there are areas that need further scrutiny, especially as regards structured products and treatment of off-balance-sheet entities, and thus further adjustments to frameworks are needed. given their role in the crisis, structured finance and the originate-to-distribute business model of securitization require a careful exami -nation of what needs to be fixed. it is important to note that securitization, per se, was not the problem—it was a combination of lax underwrit -ing standards in the u.s. mortgage market, the concomitant extension of securitization into increasingly complex and difficult-to-understand structures, collateralized by increasingly lower quality assets, and a favorable financial environ -executive\\\\t summar yxivment in which risks were insufficiently appre -ciated. in retrospect, not enough capital was allocated to cover these risks. although chap -ter 2 does not attempt an exhaustive analysis of the adverse incentives that led to the extreme growth in structured finance underpinning the crisis, some tentative policies can be put forward.the private sector could usefully move in the following directions: • standardization of some components of structured finance products. this could help increase market participants’ understand -ing of risks, facilitate the development of a secondary market with more liquidity, and help the comparability of valuation. standard -ization could also facilitate the development of a clearinghouse that would mutualize coun -terparty risks associated with these types of over-the-counter products. • transparency at origination and subsequently. investors will be better able to assess the risk of securitized products if they receive more timely, comprehensible, and adequate infor -mation about the underlying assets and the sensitivity of valuation to various assumptions. • reform of rating systems. a differentiated rating scale for structured credit products was recommended in the april 2006 gfsr. also, additional information on the vulnerability of structured credit products to downgrades would need to accompany the new scale for it to be meaningful. this step may require a re-assessment of the regulatory and supervisory treatment of rated securities. • transparency and disclosure. originators should disclose to their investors relevant aggregate information on key risks in off- balance-sheet entities on a timely and regular basis. these should include the reliance by institutions on credit risk mitigation instru -ments such as insurance, and the degree to which the risks reside with the sponsor, particularly in cases of distress. more gener -ally, convergence of disclosure practices (e.g., timing and content) internationally should be considered by standard setters and regulators.the official sector should examine the fol -lowing areas where the application of various standards may have systemic consequences. • greater attention to applying fair value accounting results. the prospects of forced sales triggered by fair value below some threshold will need to be examined thor -oughly. ways of guiding firms to review the elements underlying the valuation without being forced to sell would be helpful. the extent to which such fair value “triggers” are either encouraged or mandated in regulation and supervisory guidance would need to be re-evaluated. it is the role of prudential super -vision to judge the reliability of various meth -ods used to establish fair values, especially when a marked-to-model approach is used. accounting standard setters will increasingly need to take into account the financial stabil -ity implications in their accounting practices and guidance.• incentives to set up sivs and conduits. in principle, basel ii provides less incentive than basel i to transfer risks to such entities for the purpose of lowering regulatory capital charges. nonetheless, a strict implementation of basel ii by national supervisors, possibly armed with stronger guidance regarding conditions for risk transfer and appropriate capital relief, will be needed. accounting stan -dards setters, in cooperation with supervisors, should revisit consolidation rules to address incentives that may encourage a lack of trans -parency regarding off-balance-sheet activities and risks. • tighten oversight of mortgage originators. in the united states, broadening 2006 and 2007 bank guidance notes on good lending practices to cover nonbank mortgage origi -nators should be considered. the efficiency of coordination across banking regulators would also be enhanced if the fragmentation across the various regulatory bodies were addressed. consideration could be given to devising mechanisms that would leave origi -nators with a financial stake in the loans they originate. xvanother area in which weaknesses contrib -uted to the crisis is financial institutions’ liquid -ity management. it is now obvious that various factors may have encouraged financial institu -tions to insufficiently protect themselves against an adverse liquidity event—a situation that needs to be addressed.for financial institutions, the crisis has pro -vided many important lessons including those involving:• liquidity risk management. firms will need to factor in more severe price jumps (“gapping”) and correlation movements in their market risk models, employing adjustments to risk measures where possible. better stress tests could be undertaken with longer periods of funding illiquidity and improved contingency plans. more transparency regarding how liquidity risk is managed within the firm could be available to investors.• more realistic assumptions about the liquidity of complex structured securities. firms’ reli -ance on highly structured securities to gener -ate collateral proved problematic during the crisis. greater availability on balance sheets of highly liquid assets to use as collateral could allow institutions easier access to funding sources during periods of stress.financial regulators and supervisory authori -ties also need to take a more active role in reviewing liquidity management issues and supervisory guidance, and considering other regulatory improvements.• strengthen existing international liquidity guidance. the basel committee’s working group on liquidity is already considering how to strengthen its existing guidance in this area, and prompt review would be welcome. the use of multiple currencies for funding globally active banks suggests that a more uni -fied approach to liquidity management across countries may be needed. • monitoring best practices. a better method of monitoring progress toward achieving “best practices” for liquidity management (e.g., those of the basel committee, the joint forum, and the institute of international finance) could help prevent gaps across institutions. if progress is insufficient, a pillar 2-like system may be needed, whereby supervisors are tasked with ensuring that adequate bank liquidity management systems are in place and that banks hold sufficient liquidity buffers and have well-formulated contingency plans.monetary authorities as well need to review their operational practices in light of the crisis. this event has required unprecedented liquidity infusions to the interbank market and the use of operational instruments that had not been used before. central banks should now converge to policies that have worked during the crisis to improve the functioning of interbank markets and better distribute liquidity. such policies to be considered are the following :• broader range of collateral. to be expedi -ent, central banks need to be able to oper -ate with a wide range of collateral, perhaps agreeing on collateral that could be posted at multiple central banks. however, central banks will need to have a well-established collateral pricing policy to avoid taking undue credit and liquidity risks onto their own balance sheets.• wide group of counterparties. central banks should have a wide group of counterparty banks established during normal times that are eligible to receive liquidity during stressful times. altering this group during periods of stress can signal that certain banks, with per -haps newly acceptable collateral, are receiving preferential treatment.• maturity structure of liquidity provision. operational procedures enabling the provi -sion of liquidity at different maturities can be helpful. however, altering the maturity profile of the central bank’s balance sheet needs to be accompanied by communication indicat -ing how this is consistent with the monetary policy strategy.• better coordination among financial over -seers. central banks and others with over -sight over financial institutions could usefully develop closer ties and improved information executive\\\\t summar yxvisharing so as to better anticipate liquidity and solvency difficulties. central banks should ensure that they have continuous access to individual bank information so as to be able to independently judge the health of poten -tial counterparties. • supervising responsibility and enforcement. supervisors must be provided with sufficient legal powers and resources. for example, if institutions answer to multiple regulators and supervisors, the scope for ambiguity and arbitrage is magnified. therefore, it would be preferable if supervisory and enforcement responsibilities for a single institution were to be vested in a single agency. cross-border information sharing and coordination among such bodies should also be strengthened.in sum, there are a number of areas that require increased attention by private market participants and the public sector. for its part, there is room for the international monetary fund to more actively promote best practices for financial crisis and central bank liquidity management. these issues are covered in imf financial sector assessment programs, and even greater efforts will be made to apply them in the imf’s bilateral and multilateral policy advice. as the crisis is still unfolding, lessons are as yet incomplete. nonetheless, some issues need to be addressed urgently—shoring up the confi -dence in financial institutions should be a prior -ity. other issues will require more reflection and study so as to minimize unintended conse -quences of regulations or supervisory practices.']\",\n",
       " \"['ixixsince the april 2007 global financial stabil-ity report (gfsr), global ﬁ nancial stabil-ity has endured an important test. credit and market risks have risen and markets have become more volatile. markets are recognizing the extent to which credit discipline has dete-riorated in recent years—most notably in the u.s. nonprime mortgage and leveraged loan markets, but also in other related credit markets. this has prompted a retrenchment from some risky assets and deleveraging, causing a widening of credit spreads in riskier asset classes and more volatile bond and equity markets. the absence of prices and secondary markets for some struc-tured credit products, and concerns about the location and size of potential losses, has led to disruptions in some money markets and funding difﬁ culties for a number of ﬁ nancial institutions, as some counterparties have been reluctant to extend credit to those thought to hold lower quality, illiquid assets. the resulting disruption has required extraordinary liquidity injections by a number of central banks to facilitate the orderly functioning of these markets.the potential consequences of this episode should not be underestimated and the adjust-ment process is likely to be protracted. credit conditions may not normalize soon, and some of the practices that have developed in the structured credit markets will have to change. at the same time, the global economy entered this turbulent period exhibiting solid growth, especially in emerging market countries. sys-temically important ﬁ nancial institutions began this episode with adequate capital to manage the likely level of credit losses. so far, despite the signiﬁ cant ongoing correction in ﬁ nancial mar-kets, global growth remains solid, though some slowdown could be expected. downside risks have increased signiﬁ cantly and, even if those risks fail to materialize, the implications of this period of turbulence will be signiﬁ cant and far reaching. eventually, lessons for both the private sector and the regulatory and supervisory arenas will have to be drawn in order to strengthen the ﬁ nancial system against future strains.the threat to ﬁ nancial stability increased as the uncertainty became manifest in the money markets that provide short-term ﬁ nancing (espe-cially commercial paper markets). at the center of the turmoil is a funding mismatch whereby medium-term, illiquid, and hard-to-value assets, such as structured credit securities, were being funded by very short-term money market securities—often asset-backed commercial paper. the market illiquidity and the difﬁ culty in valu-ing the complex, structured products held as assets has compounded the risks of the fund-ing mismatch. thus, while potentially helping protect the ﬁ nancial system from concentrations of credit risk in banks, the dispersal of struc-tured credit products has substantially increased uncertainty about the extent of the risks and where they are ultimately held.this funding mismatch was undertaken by a signiﬁ cant number of conduits and special purpose vehicles that had assumed they could hold their illiquid assets to maturity. many have been associated with regulated banks, and to a large extent their funding strategies were backed by contingent liquidity lines from those banks. when doubts about the quality of some of the underlying assets emerged and the high ratings were perceived as less reliable, prices of the assets fell, the rollover of associated asset-backed commercial paper became very difﬁ cult, and funding began to be squeezed. as a consequence, what had been contingent, off-balance-sheet liabilities for regulated banks threatened to move “on balance sheet.” the funding difﬁ culties were ﬁ rst felt in

contingent, off-balance-sheet liabilities for regulated banks threatened to move “on balance sheet.” the funding difﬁ culties were ﬁ rst felt in europe and, subsequently, in a number of other places. the rapid transmission of disturbances in one part of the ﬁ nancial system to other parts, sometimes xthrough opaque and intertwined channels, has surprised both market participants and the ofﬁ cial sector. the uncertainty about where off- balance-sheet bank exposures will materialize next has led to a tiering of interbank lending rates. banks that are believed to either have structured credit product losses, or that need to satisfy contingent credit lines to their con-duits or special purpose vehicles, face higher interbank rates. in some cases, the ﬂ ows in the interbank market are stymied by some large banks’ desire to hold onto liquidity in case they need to ﬁ nance other activities, such as the large pipeline of leveraged buyouts scheduled for the remainder of the year. overall, there has been a sharp rise in perceived counterparty risk, and a desire to keep the additional liquidity on hand, at least for now.the april 2007 gfsr ﬂ agged the underlying causes of the current correction. the weakening of credit discipline and the potential compla-cency, which were highlighted in that edition, led to a buildup of credit risks in the u.s. mortgage market, leveraged buyout market, and some lending to emerging markets. the benign economic and ﬁ nancial conditions of recent years weakened incentives to conduct due dili-gence on borrowers and counterparties. more-over the “originate and distribute” model used for credit products by many ﬁ nancial institutions meant that many such institutions could choose not to hold the credit risk they originated, reducing their incentives to monitor borrowers. investors in the distributed securities may have relaxed their due diligence in assessing liquidity and leverage risks or chosen to rely excessively on ratings agencies to analyze risks in complex ﬁ nancial instruments. stress in the u.s. housing market then weakened mortgage-backed securi-ties, an important component of the global ﬁ nancial system.

in riskier asset classes and more volatile bond and equity markets. the absence of prices and secondary markets for some struc-tured credit products, and concerns about the location and size of

markets.the potential consequences of this episode should not be underestimated and the adjust-ment process is likely to be protracted. credit conditions may not normalize soon, and some of the

(espe-cially commercial paper markets). at the center of the turmoil is a funding mismatch whereby medium-term, illiquid, and hard-to-value assets, such as structured credit securities, were being funded by very short-term money market securities—often asset-backed commercial paper. the market illiquidity and the difﬁ culty in valu-ing the complex, structured products held as assets has compounded the risks of the fund-ing mismatch. thus, while potentially helping protect the ﬁ nancial system from concentrations of credit risk in banks, the dispersal of struc-tured credit products has substantially increased uncertainty about the extent of the risks and where they are ultimately held.this funding mismatch was undertaken by a signiﬁ cant number of conduits and special purpose vehicles that had assumed they could hold their illiquid assets to maturity. many have been associated with regulated banks, and to a large extent their funding strategies were backed by contingent liquidity lines from those banks. when doubts about the quality of some of the underlying assets emerged and the high ratings were perceived as less reliable, prices of the assets fell, the rollover

poli-cymaking frameworks. external sovereign debt has been reduced and debt structures are better managed. nonetheless, offsetting these posi-tive aspects, credit growth has been rapid in a xinumber of emerging markets, with some banks (both domestic and foreign) borrowing abroad in foreign currency to lend domestically, taking on indirect credit risks through their foreign-currency-denominated loans. in addition, the low yields in mature markets and high risk appe-tite have allowed emerging market corporates easy access to foreign capital, including through synthetic and structured products to generate higher yields.chapter 1 also looks at some of the routes taken by foreign investors to gain access to cer-tain emerging markets where there are capital account restrictions. the chapter cautions that some emerging markets are vulnerable to a pull-back in the availability of capital, and that this pullback could continue even after the mature market funding difﬁ culties subside. to under-stand in greater depth the stability implica-tions of foreign participation in local emerging markets, the chapter provides empirical work on foreign equity ﬂ ows into several different emerg-ing markets in order to distinguish between institutional investors and others. lastly, the chapter reviews the growth in the activities of hedge funds in emerging markets.chapter 1 also includes an annex exploring some aspects of sovereign wealth funds (swfs). the growth of these entities can be seen as the result of the strong accumulation of foreign assets by the ofﬁ cial sector—in part, due to high natural resources prices or prompted by large balance of payments surpluses and capital inﬂ ows. swfs are becoming an important inves-tor group, and questions have been raised about the impact of their cross-border asset allocations. the annex attempts to clarify some of the dis-cussion surrounding their structures and goals by providing a taxonomy of sovereign wealth funds and their asset allocation frameworks.although the recent episode of turbulence is ongoing, and it is too early to make deﬁ nitive conclusions, it is already clear from the analy-sis in chapter 1 that several areas will require increased attention. the ﬁ rst is the important role of uncertainty and lack of information. accurate and timely information about underly-ing risks are critical components in the market’s ability to differentiate and properly price risk. this would include both qualitative and quanti-tative information about how risks are managed, valued, and accounted for, especially in areas of risk transfer. greater transparency is also needed on links between systemically important ﬁ nan-cial institutions and some of their off- balance-sheet vehicles. only by disclosing fully their interrelationships with asset managers, conduits, and special purpose entities will investors be able to assess the true creditworthiness of the institutions with which they deal. however, given the volume and complexity of the information that could potentially be provided, and the cost of providing it, it will be important to carefully consider the appropriate amount and type of disclosure needed to alleviate the problems evident in this episode.second, while securitization, and ﬁ nancial innovation more generally, through enhanced risk distribution have made markets more efﬁ -cient, there is a need to understand how they may have contributed to the current situation. in particular, it is important to consider the extent to which the incentive structure, in the context of very benign times, may have diluted the incentives for originating lenders to monitor risk. in the u.s. mortgage market, the public sector costs associated with the lack of supervi-sory oversight of some mortgage originators will need to be balanced against the improved access to credit that some households received. gener-ally, the relationship between checks and bal-ances throughout the supply chain of structured products may require some rethinking.third, there is a need to examine risk analysis of credit derivatives and structured products and the role of ratings agencies. ratings and ratings agencies will continue to be a fundamental com-ponent in the functioning of ﬁ nancial markets. however, there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive the same ratings. ratings of complex structured products may have become too connected to ixixsince the

there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive the same ratings. ratings of complex structured products may have become too connected to xiifacilitating origination. in periods of turbulence, the rapid downgrades then raise questions about the reliability of these ratings and their useful-ness for the investors. we repeat the call from the april 2006 gfsr for a more differentiated scale of ratings for structured products. inves-tors also have an obligation and responsibility to understand the dynamics and liquidity risks asso-ciated with the products they buy—they wrongly assumed that a low probability of default meant a low likelihood of losses from market move-ments. in the case of complex structured credit products, investors need to look behind the ratings—they should not assume that the simple letter ratings provided by ratings agencies show equivalent risks as those for other asset classes. differentiation and transparency in the underly-ing assumptions and construction of the various structures would facilitate appropriate due diligence by investors.fourth, the valuation of complex products in the context of a market where liquidity is insuf-ﬁ cient to provide reliable market prices requires more consideration. when purchasing complex products, investors will need to consider the asso-ciated liquidity aspects and include an appropri-ate liquidity risk “premium” as part of the price. financial institutions holding such securities as collateral will need to assign a “haircut” that factors in liquidity characteristics. importantly, ﬁ nancial institutions need to make sure that they have robust funding strategies appropriately suited for their business model and that such funding strategies can accommodate stressful conditions. more generally, the rapid growth of some illiquid instruments raises questions about whether originators of such securities should be expected to provide secondary markets to con-tribute to the valuation process.fifth, the relevant perimeter of risk consoli-dation for banks has proved to be larger than the usual accounting or legal perimeters. there are two notable examples: (1) reputational risk may force banks to internalize losses of legally independent entities; and (2) new instruments or structures may mask off-balance-sheet or contingent liabilities. the result is that risks that appear to have been distributed may yet return in various forms to the banks that distributed them. the relevant perimeter is not only an issue for supervisors, but also for the ﬁ nancial institutions themselves—their risk management systems, audit processes and internal oversight and governance structures.policymakers now face a delicate balancing act. they must establish frameworks that encour-age investors to maintain high credit standards and strengthen risk management systems in good times as well as bad. actions should only be undertaken if the public policy beneﬁ ts outweigh the costs, taking care to thoroughly examine pos-sible unintended consequences. in general, the current regulatory systems have proven resilient to date, and regulators must be continually mind-ful that households and ﬁ rms have beneﬁ ted greatly from the ﬁ nancial innovation and solid growth and ﬁ nancial stability of recent years.* * *chapters 2 and 3 examine two respective issues that are the outcome of the lengthy period of low mature market yields and unusu-ally low ﬁ nancial market volatility over the last several years. chapter 2 examines the extent to which market risk management methods may have encouraged more risk-taking during this relatively benign period, perhaps resulting in a more rapid withdrawal from risky assets than would otherwise be the case as conditions change. in light of rapid capital ﬂ ows to emerg-ing market countries, chapter 3 investigates how countries can best deal with capital ﬂ ow volatility in the medium term by improving the depth, liquidity, and institutional quality of their domes-tic ﬁ nancial markets.chapter 2 speciﬁ cally examines market risk management techniques to see whether their common usage, while seemingly prudent for individual institutions, could exacerbate mar-ket volatility during periods of stressful market conditions. the question is examined in two ways. the ﬁ rst is by using a stylized version of the most common market risk model, value-at-risk (var), which is the estimated loss a ﬁ rm is ixixsince the april 2007 global financial stabil-ity report (gfsr), global ﬁ nancial stabil-ity has endured an important test. credit and market risks have risen and markets have become more

capital, and that this pullback could continue even after the mature market funding difﬁ culties subside. to under-stand in greater depth the stability implica-tions of foreign participation in local emerging markets, the chapter provides empirical work on foreign equity ﬂ ows into several different emerg-ing markets in order to distinguish between institutional investors and others. lastly, the chapter reviews the growth in the activities of hedge funds in emerging markets.chapter 1 also includes an annex exploring some aspects of sovereign wealth funds (swfs). the growth of these entities can be seen as the result of the strong accumulation of foreign assets by the ofﬁ cial sector—in part, due to high natural resources prices or prompted by large balance of payments surpluses and capital inﬂ ows. swfs are becoming an important inves-tor group, and questions have been raised about the impact of their cross-border asset allocations. the annex attempts to clarify some of the dis-cussion surrounding their structures and goals by providing a taxonomy of sovereign wealth funds and their asset allocation frameworks.although the recent episode of turbulence is ongoing, and it is too early to make deﬁ nitive conclusions, it is already clear from the analy-sis in chapter 1 that several areas will require increased attention. the ﬁ rst is the important role of uncertainty and lack of information. accurate and timely information about underly-ing risks are critical components in the market’s ability to differentiate and properly price risk. this would include both qualitative and quanti-tative information about how risks are managed, valued, and accounted for, especially in areas of risk transfer. greater transparency is also needed on links between systemically important ﬁ nan-cial institutions and some of their off- balance-sheet vehicles. only by disclosing fully their interrelationships with asset managers, conduits, and special purpose entities will investors be able to assess the true creditworthiness of the institutions with which they deal. however, given the volume and complexity of the information that could potentially be provided, and the cost of providing it, it will be important to carefully consider the appropriate amount and type of disclosure needed to alleviate the problems evident in this episode.second, while securitization, and ﬁ nancial innovation more generally, through enhanced risk distribution have made markets more efﬁ -cient, there is a need to understand how they may have contributed to the current situation. in particular, it is important to consider the extent to which the incentive structure, in the context of very benign times, may have diluted the incentives for originating lenders to monitor risk. in the u.s. mortgage market, the public sector costs associated with the lack of supervi-sory oversight of some mortgage originators will need to be balanced against the improved access to credit that some households received. gener-ally, the relationship between checks and bal-ances throughout the supply chain of structured products may require some rethinking.third, there is a need to examine risk analysis of credit derivatives and structured products and the role of ratings agencies. ratings and ratings agencies will continue to be a fundamental com-ponent in the functioning of ﬁ nancial markets. however, there is some concern about the rating methodology of complex products, particularly when securities, with very different structures, assumptions, and liquidity characteristics, receive the same ratings. ratings of complex structured products may have become too connected to xiifacilitating origination. in periods of turbulence, the rapid downgrades then raise questions about the reliability of these ratings and their useful-ness for the investors. we repeat the call from the april 2006 gfsr for a more differentiated scale of ratings for structured products. inves-tors also have an obligation and responsibility to understand the dynamics and liquidity risks asso-ciated with the products they buy—they wrongly assumed that a low probability of default meant a low likelihood of losses from market move-ments. in the case of complex structured credit products, investors need to look behind the ratings—they should not assume that the simple letter ratings provided by ratings agencies show equivalent risks as those for other asset classes. differentiation and transparency in the underly-ing assumptions and construction of the various structures would facilitate appropriate due diligence by investors.fourth, the valuation of complex products in the context of a market where liquidity is insuf-ﬁ cient to provide reliable market prices requires more consideration. when purchasing complex products, investors will need to consider the asso-ciated liquidity aspects and include an appropri-ate liquidity risk “premium” as part of the price. financial institutions holding such securities as collateral will need to assign a “haircut” that factors in liquidity characteristics. importantly, ﬁ nancial institutions need to make sure that they have robust funding strategies appropriately suited for their business model and that such funding strategies can accommodate stressful conditions. more generally, the rapid growth of some illiquid instruments raises questions about whether originators of such securities should be expected to provide secondary markets to con-tribute to the valuation process.fifth, the relevant perimeter of risk consoli-dation for banks has proved to be larger than the usual accounting or legal perimeters. there are two notable examples: (1) reputational risk may force banks to internalize losses of legally independent entities; and (2) new instruments or structures may mask off-balance-sheet or contingent liabilities. the result is that risks that appear to have been distributed may yet return in various forms to the banks that distributed them. the relevant perimeter is not only an issue for supervisors, but also for the ﬁ nancial institutions themselves—their risk management systems, audit processes and internal oversight and governance structures.policymakers now face a delicate balancing act. they must establish frameworks that encour-age investors to maintain high credit standards and strengthen risk management systems in good times as well as bad. actions should only be undertaken if the public policy beneﬁ ts outweigh the costs, taking care to thoroughly examine pos-sible unintended consequences. in general, the current regulatory systems have proven resilient to date, and regulators must be continually mind-ful that households and ﬁ rms have beneﬁ ted greatly from the ﬁ nancial innovation and solid growth and ﬁ nancial stability of recent years.* * *chapters 2 and 3 examine two respective issues that are the outcome of the lengthy period of low mature market yields and unusu-ally low ﬁ nancial market volatility over the last several years. chapter 2 examines the extent to which market risk management methods may have encouraged more risk-taking during this relatively benign period, perhaps resulting in a more rapid withdrawal from risky assets than would otherwise be the case as conditions change. in light of rapid capital ﬂ ows to emerg-ing market countries, chapter 3 investigates how countries can best deal with capital ﬂ ow volatility in the medium term by improving the depth, liquidity, and institutional quality of their domes-tic ﬁ nancial markets.chapter 2 speciﬁ cally examines market risk management techniques to see whether their common usage, while seemingly prudent for individual institutions, could exacerbate mar-ket volatility during periods of stressful market conditions. the question is examined in two ways. the ﬁ rst is by using a stylized version of the most common market risk model, value-at-risk (var), which is the estimated loss a ﬁ rm is xiiiunlikely to exceed at a given degree of conﬁ -dence. for instance, a ﬁ rm’s one-day estimated var of $10 million at a conﬁ dence level of 95 percent implies that the ﬁ rm would expect to lose more than $10 million on its portfolio only ﬁ ve days out of 100. a stylized model is used to demonstrate how var declines during a lower volatility environment, but rises when higher volatility returns. the stylized portfolios are then “stressed” by examining how var would respond with data from previous episodes of ﬁ nancial market turbulence. lastly, simulations are con-ducted in which several ﬁ rms are hypothesized to use the same, or slightly different, var mod-els, also during periods of stress. results suggest that such ﬁ rms, acting according to their own models to contain risks, could collectively make markets more volatile, especially if risk aversion is low. the simulations also show, however, that a greater diversity of models would help to reduce such potential instability.chapter 2 also examines risk management procedures of investment banks and hedge funds to see whether they conform to the pre-conditions necessary to amplify market volatil-ity in practice. while all ﬁ rms maintain that they would not rigidly follow their var models in stressful circumstances, there are a number of ways in which var metrics, or related risk limits, could act to amplify market volatility. in fact, recent turbulence suggests some of these techniques may be contributing to the current turbulent conditions to some degree. overall, var and other risk management techniques will encourage ﬁ nancial institutions to respond more rapidly to changes in risk. normally, this will facilitate early detection and prompt cor-rection of risks deemed excessive by the institu-tion. however, the use of similar techniques across institutions during periods of stress can lead to larger price movements than would occur if different techniques were used. it is thus worthwhile for regulators and supervi-sors to acknowledge the beneﬁ ts of discretion when implementing risk management systems (including new ways to incorporate credit and liquidity risks) and to promote the use of “stress testing”—encouraging all ﬁ rms to consider their interactive effects during periods of stress, as some do already. a diversity of investment positions and types of participants is even more important to help stabilize markets. regulators and supervisors would also do well to consider more concretely than they do now how they would respond to the amplifying effects when individual ﬁ rms naturally attempt to protect their ﬁ rm’s franchise value.chapter 3 empirically analyzes a common view—whether, in addition to strong macro-economic fundamentals, a well-functioning domestic ﬁ nancial market encourages capital inﬂ ows and reduces their volatility over the medium term. a panel estimation technique is used to examine the factors that determine the volume and volatility of annual capital inﬂ ows for a sample of developed and emerging market economies from 1977 to 2006. the factors include ﬁ nancial variables such as equity market depth and liquidity and ﬁ nancial openness, and a shorter sample also includes institutional quality variables such as corporate governance quality and accounting standards. the results of the empirical work show that the liquidity of equity markets and ﬁ nancial openness positively inﬂ uence the level of capital inﬂ ows. moreover, the panel estimations show that more ﬁ nancial openness reduces the volatility of inﬂ ows. sepa-rately, the chapter shows that improvements in a broad set of institutional quality variables are correlated with lower volatility. chapter 3 also examines how ﬁ ve emerging market countries have coped with the recent rise in capital inﬂ ows and discusses some of their pol-icy options. these ﬁ ve country examples reveal the difﬁ culty of ﬁ nding a common set of ﬁ nancial policies that help deal with capital inﬂ ows. gener-ally, policies that encourage ﬁ nancial market development over the medium term—including a well-regulated system, better transparency and broader institutional quality, and improved risk management for ﬁ nancial institutions—will likely cushion the ﬁ nancial system from the potentially destabilizing effects of abrupt capital outﬂ ows better than will short-term ﬁ xes.']\",\n",

many mature markets, with investors seeking higher-yielding assets in some emerg-ing markets and other mature markets. chapter i examines this investor strategy—the carry trade—noting that while countries’ fundamen-tals have improved and sovereign external debt has become less risky, international issuance of corporate debt and equities has risen rapidly to accommodate investor demand. a theme of chapter iii—that the globaliza-tion of banks may help reduce individual bank risk but may not necessarily enhance the resil-ience of ﬁnancial systems as a whole—is also echoed in chapter i, which examines possible spillovers from a deterioration in credit quality in the u.s. subprime mortgage market. chapter i identiﬁes several short-term risks. first, the subprime segment of the u.s. housing market is showing signs of credit quality deterio-ration. while the fallout to date has been lim-ited, there is scope for it to deepen and spread to other markets, possibly to structured mort-gage credit products held by a variety of global investors. fortunately, the economic impact of the housing market slowdown has been limited and some market indicators have begun to sta-bilize, suggesting that the ﬁnancial effects may also be contained. second, low interest rates and healthy cor-porate balance sheets have spurred an increase in private equity buyouts. this has led to a sub-stantial rise in leverage in the acquired ﬁrms, potentially making such ﬁrms more vulnerable to economic shocks. the increased use of lever-aged loans as part of ﬁnancing also poses risks to some intermediaries that provide bridge ﬁnancing to leveraged-buyout transactions. the situation bears careful attention, especially if a large high-proﬁle deal runs into difﬁculty, as this could trigger a wider reappraisal of the risks involved.third, capital inﬂows to some emerging markets have risen rapidly, in part reﬂecting improved economic fundamentals, but also reﬂecting the search for yield given low interest rates in most mature markets. in general, strong private capital inﬂows are to be welcomed, as they reﬂect a reallocation of capital to more productive investments. however, the shift to private sector debt ﬂows, especially bank-based ﬂows into emerging europe and portfolio ﬂows into other regions, including sub-saharan africa, shows that foreign investors are taking more risk and an abrupt reversal cannot be ruled out. finally, while the downside risk from a pos-sible disorderly unwinding of global imbalances has receded somewhat, it remains a concern. the larger role of ﬁxed-income inﬂows in ﬁnancing the u.s. current account deﬁcit indi-cates that inﬂows into u.s. bond markets may have become more sensitive to changes in world interest rate differentials.

the backdrop of continued global growth, none of the individually identiﬁed risks by themselves threaten ﬁnancial stability. how-ever, with volatility across asset classes close to historic lows and spreads on a variety of credit instruments tight, investors may not have ade-quately factored in the possibility that a “volatil-ity shock” may be ampliﬁed given the increased linkages across products and markets. institu-tions may well be acting in accordance with their own incentives, but collectively their behavior may cause a buildup of investment positions in certain markets, possibly resulting in a disor-derly correction when conditions change. for instance, the rapid growth of some innovative instruments, the rise in leverage in parts of the ﬁnancial system, and the growth of carry trades suggest that market participants are expecting a continuation of the low volatility environment and that a sustained rise in volatility could per-turb a wide range of markets.chapter ii examines the recent acceleration in the accumulation of international assets as well as the investors behind rising cross-border ﬂows. as noted above, ﬂows and stocks of cross-border claims have increased both in absolute size and relative to the volume of domestic economic activity. the diversity of assets, source countries, and investor types now involved in cross-border asset accumulation suggests more stable ﬂows. however, for some countries, the sharp increase in capital inﬂows has contributed to rapid credit growth and asset price inﬂa-tion, at times complicating the conduct of poli-cies. furthermore, foreign investors have been venturing into markets previously regarded as excessively risky for outsiders, encouraged by the generally benign ﬁnancial environment. policymakers can take advantage of these secular changes and at the same time minimize pockets of vulnerabilities that have become apparent. recipient countries have to con-tinue to establish a track record of credible macroeconomic policies. vulnerabilities can be reduced by promoting efﬁciency, stability, and the effective regulation of domestic capital mar-kets (including the development of local debt markets) so as to increase their attractiveness to a stable investor base. liberalization of capital outﬂows from domestic investors, though not a panacea, may help balance the effects of capital inﬂows and allow domestic investors to better manage their risk.chapter iii examines the implications of the accelerating globalization of ﬁnancial institutions––particularly banks––for global ﬁnancial stability. the institutional and regional pattern of globalization is remarkably varied. for large banks, greater geographical disper-sion of assets and revenues tends to be associ-ated with better share price performance and lower default risks. however, while cross-border diversiﬁcation seems to be associated positively with the stability of the individual institution, the ﬁnancial system as a whole may not be more stable, with the potential for linkages among markets and activities having increased. this is an especially important result for countries in regions with heavy foreign bank penetration across correlated economies.the chapter highlights two clear priorities to help to contain the potential contagion risk arising from institutional globalization while maximizing its beneﬁts. first, supervisors need to collaborate ever more closely in the oversight of cross-border institutions. second, authorities need to continue improving crisis management procedures with the counterparts with whom they share the greatest overlapping responsi-bilities and interests. while the jurisdiction of supervisors and regulators remains predomi-nantly domestic, at odds with the scope of activi-ties of global institutions, these practical steps can go some way toward addressing the chal-lenges to ﬁnancial stability posed by institutional globalization.']\",\n",

thus household balance sheets may come under pressure as these conditions reverse. under more adverse circumstances, the weaknesses in household balance sheets could increase stress on the financial sector, weaken property prices, and slow down consumption spending. there are also important localized concerns. for example, in some emerging european econo -mies, credit-driven consumption has led to a deterioration of external balances, with house -hold borrowers exposed to potentially large interest and exchange rate risks and declining house prices .em policymakers can take several steps to prevent or mitigate risks associated with a buildup in household credit. these include adopting prudent macroeconomic management that can help lower the risk of large shocks to household incomes, exchange rates, or inter -est rates; introducing sound prudential norms for household credit and encouraging good origination standards and information sharing \\\\x18\\\\x18iby banks; and developing the necessary legal and regulatory framework and infrastructure. while em countries have made improvements in recent years, substantial progress remains to be made in all three areas. these measures will allow ems to reap the substantial benefits of developing this market, while avoiding boom-bust cycles during the formative years .']\",\n",

macroeconomic policies (see the april 2011 world economic outlook), but fragilities remain. the two-speed recovery—modest in advanced econo-mies and robust in emerging market economies—has posed different policy challenges for countries. in advanced economies hit hardest by the crisis, govern-ments and households remain heavily indebted, to varying degrees, and the health of financial institutions has not recovered in tandem with the overall economy. emerging market economies are facing new challenges associated with strong domestic demand, rapid credit growth, relatively accommodative macroeconomic pol-icies, and large capital inflows. geopolitical risks could also threaten the economic and financial outlook, with oil prices increasing sharply amid fears of supply disruptions in the middle east and north africa.the main task facing policymakers in advanced econ-omies is to shift the balance of policies away from reli-ance on macroeconomic and liquidity support to more structural policies—less “leaning” and more “cleaning” of the financial system. this will entail reducing leverage and restoring market discipline, while avoiding financial or economic disruption during the transition. thus, ongoing policy efforts to withdraw (implicit) public guarantees and ensure bondholder liability for future losses must build on more rapid progress toward stron-ger bank balance sheets, ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and addressing excessive debt burdens in the private sector. for policymakers in emerging market economies, the task is to limit overheating and a buildup of vul-nerabilities—to avoid “cleaning” later. emerging mar-ket economies have continued to benefit from strong growth relative to that in advanced economies, accom-panied by increasing portfolio capital inflows. this is putting pressure on some financial markets, contribut-ing to higher leverage, potential asset price bubbles, and inflationary pressures. policymakers will have to pay increasing attention to containing the buildup of macrofinancial risks to avoid future problems that could inhibit their growth and damage financial stability. in a number of cases, this will entail a tighter macroeconomic policy stance, and, when needed, the use of macroprudential tools to ensure financial stabil-ity. increasing the financial sector’s capacity to absorb higher flows through efforts to broaden and deepen local capital markets will also help. in the next few months, the most pressing challenge is the funding of banks and sovereigns, particularly in some vulnerable euro area countries. as detailed in chapter 1 of this global financial stability report, policies aimed at fiscal consolidation and strengthening bank balance sheets in these countries should be sup-ported by credible assurances that multilateral backstops are sufficiently flexible and endowed to facilitate an orderly deleveraging without triggering further fiscal or bank funding strains. in other countries, funding is less problematic, but still a concern. under a baseline scenario, higher funding costs and a rising government debt stock will cause government interest payments to increase in most advanced economies (see also the april 2011 fiscal monitor). if deficit reduction con-tinues as projected, the interest costs should generally remain manageable, although much greater progress on medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies will be needed in both the united states and japan to avoid downside risks to financial stability and to preserve confidence. in japan, the immediate fiscal priority is to support reconstruction following the earthquake, returning in due course to progress toward medium-term consolidation goals.overall, despite

banking systems of many advanced economies has not been restored and continues to interact adversely with the sovereign risks in the euro area. analysis presented in this report suggests that in order to restore market confidence and reduce excessive reliance on central bank funding, considerable further strengthening of euro area bank balance sheets will be needed. this will require higher capital levels, if a detrimental xii international monetary fund | april 2011process of deleveraging is to be avoided, and a set of mostly smaller banks will have to be restructured and, where necessary, resolved. in the united states, a lackluster housing market, legacy mortgage problems, and a backlog of foreclosures continue to put pres-sure on the banking system, limiting credit creation and a return to a fully functioning mortgage market. larger bank capital buffers and strengthened balance sheets will also be necessary as countries transition to a new and more demanding regulatory regime. countries in which banking systems are still strug-gling should enhance transparency (including through more rigorous and realistic stress tests) and recapitalize, restructure, and (if necessary) close weak institutions. without these longer-term financial sector reforms, short-term funding difficulties may escalate into another systemic liquidity event. measuring and mitigating systemic liquidity risks should be at the forefront of the agenda of policymak-ers. those risks were a main feature of the latest crisis and have yet to be addressed. chapter 2 takes a close look at this topic, examining the role that basel iii liquidity requirements will play when they are intro-duced. the analysis suggests that, while helping to raise liquidity buffers, basel iii will be unable to fully address the systemic nature of liquidity risk. the chap-ter provides some illustrative techniques for measuring systemic liquidity risk and firms’ contribution to it, and suggests some accompanying macroprudential tools that could, after further refinement and testing, be used to mitigate such risks. for instance, one of the approaches provides a way to gauge, based on a firm’s assets and liabilities and its interbank connections, the higher capital needed to ensure that its risk of insolvency does not cause a destabilizing liquidity run during stressful periods. tools of this type would allow for more effective sharing of the private-public burden of systemic liquidity risk and help reduce central bank interventions during periods of stress.a common feature of the crisis in many coun-tries was excessive and misallocated credit growth, which helped fuel housing market booms. chapter 3 examines the connections between the housing finance systems and financial stability, noting that the structure of some countries’ housing finance systems led to a deeper housing bust and financial instability. the chapter suggests a set of best practices for hous-ing finance. for the united states, where the housing market and its financing are still problematic, these best practices imply that there should be better-defined and more transparent government participa-tion in the housing market, including a diminished role of the two large government-sponsored entities (freddie mac and fannie mae). these goals will need to be pursued incrementally, while taking into account the still-weak housing market and economic recovery. economies seeking to create a strong housing finance system are advised to “go back to basics”—ensuring safe loan origination and encourag-ing simple and transparent mortgage contracts.global financial stabilit y report durable financial stability: getting there from here']\",\n",

regulation and better private sector practice will be needed to align incentives of those institu-tions taking part in securitization and avoid it contributing to systemic instability once more. xviiin redesigning regulation and market practices, the benefits of transferring credit risk outside the banking system and the ability of lenders to diversify funding sources need to be retained.the chapter suggests that a robust private securitization market requires policy action in several areas, including credit rating agency oversight, accounting practices, capital charges, and retention policies. this action needs to be coordinated across regulators within a country and internationally. the chapter illustrates the potential dangers of uncoordinated responses by examining the impact of retention policies and capital requirements imposed on origina-tors and shows that these could, in some cases, fail to encourage screening and monitoring or, in other cases, make securitization prohibitively expensive. undertaking careful impact stud-ies before introducing new regulations should ensure that their interaction and potential for damaging unintended consequences is recog-nized in advance. the chapter also examines the benefits and costs of issuing covered bonds, in which the loan cash flows are pooled but kept on the balance sheet of the issuing entity. this method has the advantage that the issuer has an incentive to screen and monitor the loans, but because they remain on the issuer’s balance sheet, capital must still be held against them, reducing the benefits of securitization. none-theless, the advantages of capital-market-type financing—selling the bonds to investors—al-lows more intermediation to occur. on balance, the chapter concludes that this model, too, should be encouraged with appropriate legisla-tion and regulation.policies needed to underpin financial system recovery and reformthe policy response to dislocations in fund-ing and credit markets has been unprecedented and, though definitive conclusions are difficult to make on the longer-term benefits, the initial evidence is generally positive. chapter 3 takes an early look at the very short-term impact and more medium-term effects of conventional and unconventional policy responses, including whether they stabilized financial markets at the time of their announcement. some unconventional policies have provided support better than others. the chapter looks at the impact of interven-tion announcements made by 13 advanced economies. those aimed at supporting liquidity were most effective prior to the lehman broth-ers event, but were less so once it was evident that the financial crisis had become one of solvency rather than liquidity risk in a number of countries. correspondingly, announcements of capital injections were most effective in reducing the default risk of banks in the post-lehman period, as was the announcement of the potential use of asset purchases. another important result is that interventions aimed at domestic institutions or markets had important spillover effects to other countries, with mag-nitudes sometimes larger than in the home country. this underlines the critical importance of coordinating policy responses. although it is too soon to gauge with confi-dence the longer-term effects of these policy actions, initial evidence suggests that some facilities have been effective in supporting fund-ing and issuance activity. examples include the bank liability guarantees introduced in several countries, the u.s. term asset-backed securi-ties loan facility with its impact on secondary market spreads and issuance of consumer asset-backed securities, and the european central bank’s decision to purchase covered bonds outright, which helped to lower spreads and reenergize issuance.it is too early to withdraw official support policies, but a strategy for disengagement is needed.while the time is not ripe for a full-fledged disengagement from all the unconventional policies undertaken—indeed in some countries additional public resources may still be need-ed—it is time for policymakers to consider and articulate how and in what sequence policies xvprospects for the road aheadthe immediate outlook for the financial system has improved markedly since the april 2009 global financial stability report

and a with-drawal of extraordinary public support to the financial system. some medium-term policy options are also discussed that aim to reshape the financial landscape. extreme systemic risks have abated, but complacency about banking system repair is still a concern.a key question addressed is whether the financial system can provide sufficient credit to sustain an economic recovery. recently, bank balance sheets have benefited from capital-raising efforts and positive earnings. nonethe-less, there are still serious concerns that credit deterioration will continue to put pressure on banks’ balance sheets. our analysis suggests that u.s. banks are more than halfway through the loss cycle to 2010, whereas in europe loss recog-nition is less advanced, reflecting differences in the economic cycle. while stronger bank earnings are supporting capital levels, they are not expected to fully off-set writedowns over the next 18 months. more-over, steady-state earnings are likely to be lower in the post-crisis environment. stronger action to address impaired assets will help bolster bank earning capability and support lending. systemic risks have been substantially reduced following unprecedented policy actions and nascent signs of improvement in the real economy. there is growing confidence that the global economy has turned the corner, underpinning the improvements in financial markets. nonetheless, the risk of a reintensification of the adverse feedback loop between the real and financial sectors remains sig-nificant as long as banks remain under strain and households and financial institutions need to reduce leverage. although indicators of sovereign risk are lower than six months ago, the transfer of financial risks to fiscal authorities, combined with the financing burden of fiscal stimulus, has raised concerns over crowding out the private sector and the sustainability of public sector finances. these vulnerabilities underscore the need to strengthen financial intermediation, restore health to the financial system, and eventually reduce the private risks now borne by sovereign balance sheets. great care in disengaging from public support will be necessary to avoid either sparking a second-ary crisis through premature withdrawal or endangering monetary and fiscal credibility through a belated exit. complacency now becomes a risk—banking system problems could go unresolved and much-needed regulatory reforms may be delayed or diluted. policymakers should promptly provide a plan for the future regulatory framework that mitigates the buildup of systemic risks, grounds expectations, and underpins confidence, thereby contributing to sustained economic growth.xvithe tightening of bank regulation under way is expected to reduce net revenues and require more costly self-insurance through higher levels of capital and liquidity.crisis risks in emerging markets have subsided, but vulnerabilities remain. tail risks in emerging markets have declined as a result of strong policy measures—including increased imf resources. financial stresses have eased substantially in emerging europe, but vulnerabilities remain high. western european banks appear able to absorb deteriorating credit conditions in emerging europe, but may lack sufficient capital to support a recovery in the region. asia and latin america have bene -fited most from the stabilization of core markets and a recovery in portfolio inflows. although international flows into emerging market debt have recovered, they have been skewed toward higher quality borrowers, leaving many corpo -rates facing substantial rollover risks, particu -larly in emerging europe. financial policies should continue to foster an orderly adjustment of bank, corporate, and household balance sheets. extending agreements to maintain or even increase sustainable cross-border bank funding channels would also help.impaired credit channels may face difficulty meeting even tepid private sector demand.with ongoing bank deleveraging pressure and dislocations in securitization markets, our sce-narios envisage the supply of bank credit falling for the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 both in the united states and europe. when set against projected demand for credit by the public and private sectors, it appears that ex ante supply may fall short of even anemic private sector demand. as a result, pressure on funding rates could increase and the flow of credit to support recovery could be curtailed. the results high-light which areas are likely to suffer the tightest credit conditions and where prolonged policy interventions are needed to ensure an adequate flow of credit, particularly with the authorities’ objective of keeping interest rates low.the transfer of private risks to sovereign balance sheets needs careful management.the transfer of risk to public balance sheets as a result of financial system rescues and fis-cal stimulus packages has raised concerns that record sovereign issuance could push up interest rates and hurt the nascent recovery. in this con-text, credit capacity could struggle to meet even tepid private sector demand, while deteriorat-ing public finances may compromise sovereign creditworthiness. countries should mitigate this risk by designing and articulating medium-term fiscal consolidation plans that take into account their financial sector stabilization policies and contingent liabilities.financial institutions need further restructuring to ensure their ability to lend and support economic recovery.credit capacity constraints suggest little room for complacency in cleansing bank balance sheets of impaired and illiquid assets and resus-citating securitization. deeper financial reform and the resolution of weak banks will be needed before authorities in many jurisdictions can fully exit from liquidity and funding provision. this calls for renewed efforts to increase bank capital and cleanse troubled assets from bank balance sheets. official stress tests are important instru-ments through which the condition of banks can be diagnosed in order to design appropri-ate strategies for recapitalization of viable banks and for careful resolution of nonviable banks. however, the public release of bank-by-bank outcomes should be considered only if effective remedies to address any capital shortfalls can also be presented. nondisclosure should not imply the absence of such remedies, if needed.incentives are critical to repair and restart securitization.given the importance of repairing credit intermediation, chapter 2 examines the role of private securitization and assesses proposals to restart the market. a combination of new regulation and better private sector practice will be needed to align incentives of those institu-tions taking part in securitization and avoid it contributing to systemic instability once more. xviiin redesigning regulation and market practices, the benefits of transferring credit risk outside the banking system and the ability of lenders to diversify funding sources need to be retained.the chapter suggests that a robust private securitization market requires policy action in several areas, including credit rating agency oversight, accounting practices, capital charges, and retention policies. this action needs to be coordinated across regulators within a country and internationally. the chapter illustrates the potential dangers of uncoordinated responses by examining the impact of retention policies and capital requirements imposed on origina-tors and shows that these could, in some cases, fail to encourage screening and monitoring or, in other cases, make securitization prohibitively expensive. undertaking careful impact stud-ies before introducing new regulations should ensure that their interaction and potential for damaging unintended consequences is recog-nized in advance. the chapter also examines the benefits and costs of issuing covered bonds, in which the loan cash flows are pooled but kept on the balance sheet of the issuing entity. this method has the advantage that the issuer has an incentive to screen and monitor the loans, but because they remain on the issuer’s balance sheet, capital must still be held against them, reducing the benefits of securitization. none-theless, the advantages of capital-market-type financing—selling the bonds to investors—al-lows more intermediation to occur. on balance, the chapter concludes that this model, too, should be encouraged with appropriate legisla-tion and regulation.policies needed to underpin financial system recovery and reformthe policy response to dislocations in fund-ing and credit markets has been unprecedented and, though definitive conclusions are difficult to make on the longer-term benefits, the initial evidence is generally positive. chapter 3 takes an early look at the very short-term impact and more medium-term effects of conventional and unconventional policy responses, including whether they stabilized financial markets at the time of their announcement. some unconventional policies have provided support better than others. the chapter looks at the impact of interven-tion announcements made by 13 advanced economies. those aimed at supporting liquidity were most effective prior to the lehman broth-ers event, but were less so once it was evident that the financial crisis had become one of solvency rather than liquidity risk in a number of countries. correspondingly, announcements of capital injections were most effective in reducing the default risk of banks in the post-lehman period, as was the announcement of the potential use of asset purchases. another important result is that interventions aimed at domestic institutions or markets had important spillover effects to other countries, with mag-nitudes sometimes larger than in the home country. this underlines the critical importance of coordinating policy responses. although it is too soon to gauge with confi-dence the longer-term effects of these policy actions, initial evidence suggests that some facilities have been effective in supporting fund-ing and issuance activity. examples include the bank liability guarantees introduced in several countries, the u.s. term asset-backed securi-ties loan facility with its impact on secondary market spreads and issuance of consumer asset-backed securities, and the european central bank’s decision to purchase covered bonds outright, which helped to lower spreads and reenergize issuance.it is too early to withdraw official support policies, but a strategy for disengagement is needed.while the time is not ripe for a full-fledged disengagement from all the unconventional policies undertaken—indeed in some countries additional public resources may still be need-ed—it is time for policymakers to consider and articulate how and in what sequence policies xviiimay be unwound. timing is complicated by the fact that some policies may be effective even if their usage is limited, as they may be bolstering confidence or acting as a backstop to a class of institutions or investors.chapter 3 outlines some considerations regarding the modalities and timing of unwind-ing unconventional policies. in general, if a facility can be phased out by raising its costs or gradually decreasing its availability, one can attempt to wean the private sector from sup-port in a gradual manner. expensive policies or those where costs are not commensurate with the benefits should be considered first for withdrawal, as should policies that significantly distort financial markets. importantly, given the global nature of the crisis and the types of unconventional policies used, attention must be paid to the cross-border impact of unwind-ing, and coordination may be helpful, notably with regard to the withdrawal of guarantees for bank debt across countries where poten-tial arbitrage opportunities can arise. clarity of communication over withdrawal strategy is critical. in this context, the use of signposts—described in terms of indicators of market conditions rather than firm deadlines—may be more helpful for influencing market expecta-tions. given that this is uncharted territory for policymakers, some experimentation may be appropriate to test market conditions. if war -ranted, reinstatement of some facilities should not be viewed as a setback.a clear vision of future financial system regulation is needed to provide clarity and boost confidence.in addition to a well-defined strategy for unwinding unconventional policies, confidence in the financial system will be bolstered by clarity over future regulatory reforms needed to address systemic risks. the recent easing of tail risks should not prompt authorities to relax their efforts to map out the path to a more robust financial system. a holistic, understand-able approach needs to be formulated so that the private sector can plan appropriately.the priority should be to reform the regula-tory environment so that the probability of a recurrence of a systemic crisis is significantly reduced. this includes not only defining the extent to which capital, provisions, and liquid-ity buffers are to rise, but also how market discipline is to be reestablished following extensive public sector support of systemic institutions in many countries. there are already proposals that will go some way toward removing procyclicality in the financial system and increasing buffers against losses and liquid-ity dislocations. but hard work lies ahead in devising capital penalties, insurance premiums, supervisory and resolution regimes, and com-petition policies to ensure that no institution is believed to be “too big to fail.” early guidance at defining criteria for identifying systemically important institutions and markets—such as that being formulated by the international monetary fund, financial stability board, and bank for international settlements for the g-20—should assist in this quest. once identi-fied, some form of surcharge or disincentive for marginal contributions to systemic risk will need to be formulated and applied.a macroprudential approach to global policymaking is needed to restore market discipline and ensure that the benefits of financial integration are preserved.the further challenge is to place these reforms in the context of an integrated macroprudential policy framework in which both domestic and cross-border institutions can operate securely. there is now recognition that a combination of microprudential and macroeconomic policies operated procyclically and led to a buildup of leverage and systemic risk. policymakers will need to address ways in which their own actions exac-erbate systemic risks, regardless of whether they oversee monetary, fiscal, or financial policy. cooperation and consistency in the policy field must extend across borders. cross-border relationships between institutions and markets have made it impossible for policymakers to act unilaterally without consequences for others. following the crisis, however, there is a danger xvprospects for the road aheadthe immediate outlook for the financial system has improved markedly since the april 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) and extreme tail risks have abated. financial markets have rebounded, emerging market risks have eased, banks have raised capital, and wholesale funding markets have reopened. even so,

       " \"['xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further

early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case

and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector

appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv xi  the global financial system remains under

structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to

crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are

intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu

hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of

as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi   promote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. restoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. fiscal stimulus to support economic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of borrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster banks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. also, seed funds for private-public partnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans. for those countries where there is fiscal room to maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at positively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. however, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. already, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is evident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the financial system is large compared to the economic size of the country. although there has been some improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. authorities should reduce their refinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows. it is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the degree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus package, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.1 where stimulus packages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 without such policies, governments may risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency. use unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets, if needed. a number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense against the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. in some cases, unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to be considered. the effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that moves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more common. as central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate exit strategies when conditions improve. govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the integrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence. for some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is complicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. some co untries may have no scope to lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. as with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. some countries may be able to ease pressures on the exchange rates by providing foreign currency liquidity.             1see the section entitled “costs of official support, potential spillovers, and policy risks” in chapter 1; and box 3.5 in chapter 3. 2see the imf paper “the state of public finances: outlook and medium-term policies after the 2008 crisis,” march 6, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . xvii xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need

countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi   promote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. restoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. fiscal stimulus to support economic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of borrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster banks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. also, seed funds for private-public partnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans. for those countries where there is fiscal room to maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at positively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. however, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. already, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is evident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the financial system is large compared to the economic size of the country. although there has been some improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. authorities should reduce their refinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows. it is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the degree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus package, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.1 where stimulus packages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 without such policies, governments may risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency. use unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets, if needed. a number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense against the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. in some cases, unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to be considered. the effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that moves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more common. as central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate exit strategies when conditions improve. govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the integrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence. for some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is complicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. some co untries may have no scope to lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. as with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. some countries may be able to ease pressures on the exchange rates by providing foreign currency liquidity.             1see the section

that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler financial instruments than the pre-crisis period. the private sector has a cen tral responsibility to contribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to governance and remuneration

impossible, but also would slow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that greater emphasis should be placed on systemically focused surveilla nce

regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. a clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear delineation of who is the lead systemic regulator. to be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be better defined and measured. chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify systemically important

february 4, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . xviii xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is

define systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential regulation. as recognized by the recent g-20 communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation needs to encompass all systemically important institutions. traditionally, only a core set of large banks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis has shown that other nonbank financial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. not only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well. in order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of institutions and markets. while certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core institutions (e.g., investment banks). moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which they are placed. a two-tiered approach may work best. a wider tier would be required to provide information from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. the other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified prudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. while these institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for consumer or investor protection purposes. chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be used to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. these methods will be further explored as the imf works toward a practical definition of a systemically important institution as requested by the g-20. prevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality. new regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the subsequent and difficult deleveraging process. finding solutions for how to limit leverage going forward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation remains challenging. regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based decision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. regulation should provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and short-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not exacerbate the present situation. capital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that permit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate and are typically underestimated. this would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to capital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. ideally, these countercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and be built into regulations. this would not limit the capacity of supervisors to act with supplementary measures if needed. an upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a supplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. accounting rules and valuation practices should be strengthened to reflect a broader range of available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. accounting standard setters and prudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on enabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion, evaluating approaches xix xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi   promote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. restoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. fiscal stimulus to support economic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of borrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster banks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. also, seed funds for private-public partnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans. for those countries where there is fiscal room to maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at positively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. however, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. already, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is evident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the financial system is large compared to the economic size of the country. although there has been some improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. authorities should reduce their refinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows. it is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the degree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus package, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.1 where stimulus packages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 without such policies, governments may risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency. use unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets, if needed. a number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense against the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. in some cases, unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to be considered. the effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that moves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more common. as central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate exit strategies when conditions improve. govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the integrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence. for some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is complicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. some co untries may have no scope to lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. as with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. some countries may be able to ease pressures on the exchange rates by providing foreign currency liquidity.             1see the section entitled “costs of official support, potential spillovers, and policy risks” in chapter 1; and box 3.5 in chapter 3. 2see the imf paper “the state of public finances: outlook and medium-term policies after the 2008 crisis,” march 6, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . xvii setting the stage for a more robust global financial system the immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. at the same time, work is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. in addition to providing for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of direction about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and improving market confidence in the short term. while many of the propo sals below may appear conceptual, their implications are real. their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes in structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3 there is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and functioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler financial instruments than the pre-crisis period. the private sector has a cen tral responsibility to contribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to governance and remuneration policies. since neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and contain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key components to preventing future crises. the empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate systemic risks through better regulation. while attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would slow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that greater emphasis should be placed on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. at the same time, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. while we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever possible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide stability is a public good that will be undervalued by private institutions and regulations will need to force systemically important firms to better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. for this to occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. a clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear delineation of who is the lead systemic regulator. to be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be better defined and measured. chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify systemically important institutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. in some cases, the measures could be viewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” even if not formally used, the proposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order to avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. more discussion and research is needed before regulations based on this work could be put into place. as regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of regulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage and reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-             3for a set of recommendations along these lines, see the imf paper “lessons of the financial crisis for future regulation of financial institutions and markets and for liquidity management,” february 4, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . xviii   border and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. the main lessons can be summarized as follows. define systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential regulation. as recognized by the recent g-20 communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation needs to encompass all systemically important institutions. traditionally, only a core set of large banks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis has shown that other nonbank financial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. not only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well. in order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of institutions and markets. while certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core institutions (e.g., investment banks). moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which they are placed. a two-tiered approach may work best. a wider tier would be required to provide information from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. the other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified prudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. while these institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for consumer or investor protection purposes. chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be used to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. these methods will be further explored as the imf works toward a practical definition of a systemically important institution as requested by the g-20. prevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality. new regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the subsequent and difficult deleveraging process. finding solutions for how to limit leverage going forward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation remains challenging. regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based decision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. regulation should provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and short-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not exacerbate the present situation. capital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that permit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate and are typically underestimated. this would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to capital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. ideally, these countercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and be built into regulations. this would not limit the capacity of supervisors to act with supplementary measures if needed. an upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a supplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. accounting rules and valuation practices should be strengthened to reflect a broader range of available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. accounting standard setters and prudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on enabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion, evaluating approaches xix  to valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly uncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair value accounting. it is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to improve liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. during upswings, greater attention needs to be given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove vulnerable during downturns. address market discipline and information gaps. it is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. in many cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed with systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires information about institutions’ exposures to one another. however, in addition to some technical difficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments to their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. consistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. better information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, derivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of indicators used in early warning frameworks. disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management practices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of systemic risk by policymakers. these elements are re inforced by the analysis in chapters 2 and 3. as well, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due diligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis. strengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. enhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in institutional and legal settings. progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling impediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early remedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border firms. an appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of regulators overseeing a firm would be essential to ensure adequate oversight. home countries should endeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are open when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. improve systemic liquidity management. in terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the crisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. another way of limiting systemic linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to provide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting trades and making the clearing facility a counterparty to every trade. recent attempts to provide some of these services for the credit default swap market are welcome. however, allowing a large number of proposed institutions risks diluting much-needed counterparty risk mitigation by splitting up the volumes and reducing netting opportunities. a competitive environment could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures that may compromise risk management systems. thus, if mult iple clearing facilities are permitted, they should be subject to strong oversight using globally accepted standards, ensuring the ability to clear and xx xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi   promote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. restoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. fiscal stimulus to support economic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of borrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster banks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. also, seed funds for private-public partnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans. for those countries where there is fiscal room to maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at positively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. however, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. already, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is evident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the financial system is large compared to the economic size of the country. although there has been some improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. authorities should reduce their refinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows. it is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the degree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus package, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.1 where stimulus packages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 without such policies, governments may risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency. use unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets, if needed. a number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense against the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. in some cases, unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to be considered. the effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that moves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more common. as central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate exit strategies when conditions improve. govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the integrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence. for some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is complicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. some co untries may have no scope to lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. as with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. some countries may be able to ease pressures on the exchange rates by providing foreign currency liquidity.             1see the section entitled “costs of official support, potential spillovers, and policy risks” in chapter 1; and box 3.5 in chapter 3. 2see the imf paper “the state of public finances: outlook and medium-term policies after the 2008 crisis,” march 6, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . xvii setting the stage for a more robust global financial system the immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. at the same time, work is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. in addition to providing for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of direction about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and improving market confidence in the short term. while many of the propo sals below may appear conceptual, their implications are real. their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes in structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3 there is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and functioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler financial instruments than the pre-crisis period. the private sector has a cen tral responsibility to contribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to governance and remuneration policies. since neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and contain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key components to preventing future crises. the empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate systemic risks through better regulation. while attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would slow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that greater emphasis should be placed on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. at the same time, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. while we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever possible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide stability is a public good that will be undervalued by private institutions and regulations will need to force systemically important firms to better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. for this to occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. a clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear delineation of who is the lead systemic regulator. to be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be better defined and measured. chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify systemically important institutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. in some cases, the measures could be viewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” even if not formally used, the proposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order to avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. more discussion and research is needed before regulations based on this work could be put into place. as regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of regulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage and reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-             3for a set of recommendations along these lines, see the imf paper “lessons of the financial crisis for future regulation of financial institutions and markets and for liquidity management,” february 4, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . xviii   border and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. the main lessons can be summarized as follows. define systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential regulation. as recognized by the recent g-20 communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation needs to encompass all systemically important institutions. traditionally, only a core set of large banks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis has shown that other nonbank financial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. not only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well. in order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of institutions and markets. while certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core institutions (e.g., investment banks). moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which they are placed. a two-tiered approach may work best. a wider tier would be required to provide information from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. the other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified prudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. while these institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for consumer or investor protection purposes. chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be used to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. these methods will be further explored as the imf works toward a practical definition of a systemically important institution as requested by the g-20. prevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality. new regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the subsequent and difficult deleveraging process. finding solutions for how to limit leverage going forward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation remains challenging. regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based decision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. regulation should provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and short-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not exacerbate the present situation. capital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that permit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate and are typically underestimated. this would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to capital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. ideally, these countercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and be built into regulations. this would not limit the capacity of supervisors to act with supplementary measures if needed. an upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a supplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. accounting rules and valuation practices should be strengthened to reflect a broader range of available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. accounting standard setters and prudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on enabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion, evaluating approaches xix  to valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly uncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair value accounting. it is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to improve liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. during upswings, greater attention needs to be given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove vulnerable during downturns. address market discipline and information gaps. it is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. in many cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed with systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires information about institutions’ exposures to one another. however, in addition to some technical difficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments to their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. consistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. better information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, derivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of indicators used in early warning frameworks. disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management practices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of systemic risk by policymakers. these elements are re inforced by the analysis in chapters 2 and 3. as well, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due diligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis. strengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. enhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in institutional and legal settings. progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling impediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early remedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border firms. an appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of regulators overseeing a firm would be essential to ensure adequate oversight. home countries should endeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are open when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. improve systemic liquidity management. in terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the crisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. another way of limiting systemic linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to provide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting trades and making the clearing facility a counterparty to every trade. recent attempts to provide some of these services for the credit default swap market are welcome. however, allowing a large number of proposed institutions risks diluting much-needed counterparty risk mitigation by splitting up the volumes and reducing netting opportunities. a competitive environment could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures that may compromise risk management systems. thus, if mult iple clearing facilities are permitted, they should be subject to strong oversight using globally accepted standards, ensuring the ability to clear and xx   settle across borders and in multiple currencies. box 2.4 provides the principles for their construction.  many of these recommendations have already been discussed in international fora and are forming the basis for new or altered regulation or supervisory guidance. the financial stability board, through its main working group, has estab lished a set of subgroups to provide policy guidance in a number of areas, including some of those emphasized here. the basel committee is considering changes to the basel ii framework and to its liquidity risk management framework. the international accounting standards board and the financial a ccounting standards board have both issued guidance on how to value illiquid assets and have made other alterations to their accounting guidance and standards given the crisis and its causes. othe r international organizati ons are reviewing their guidelines and best practices. for its part, the imf will be revamping its fina ncial sector assessment programs as well as improving its multilateral an d bilateral surveillance. the joint early warning exercise, conducted by the imf in cooperation with the financial stability board, will enhance the global coordination of risk assessments with the ai m of making stronger policy recommendations to prevent a buildup of systemic risks.  xxi xi  the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth. to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about two-thirds of which would be incurred by banks. there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain bank-supplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not   implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii  • a more active role of supervisors in determining the viability of institutions and appropriate corrective actions, including identifying capital needs based on writedowns expected during the next two years. • full and transparent disclosure of the impairment of banks’ balance sheets, vetted by supervisors based on a co nsistent set of criteria. • clarity by supervisors regarding the type of capital required—either in terms of the tangible common equity or tier 1—and the time periods allotted to reach new required capital ratios. conditions for public infusion of capital should be strict. in addition to taking stock of writedowns and available capital, bank supervisors who are in the process of evaluating the viability of banks will also need to assure themselves of the robustness of their funding structures, their business plan and risk management processes, the appropriateness of compensation policies, and the strength of management. viable banks that have insufficient ca pital should receive capital injections from the government that preferably encourages private capita l to bring capital ratios to a level sufficient to regain market confidence in the bank and should be subject to careful restructuring. while these institutions hold government capital, their operat ions should be carefully monitored and dividend payments restricted. compensation packages an d the possible replacemen t of top management should be examined carefully. nonv iable financial institutions need to be resolved as promptly as possible. such resolution may entail a merger or possi bly an orderly closure as long as it does not endanger system-wide financial stability. restructuring may require temporary government ownership. the current inability to attract private money suggests that the crisis has deepened to the point where governments need to take bolder steps and not shrink from capital injections in the form of common shares, even if it means taking majority, or even complete, control of institutions. temporary government ownership may thus be necessary, but only with the intention of restructuring the institution to return it to the private sector as rapidly as possible. most importantly, tangible common equity needs to be sufficient to allow the bank to function again—as this is the type of capi tal that markets are requiring to be held against potential writedowns. most capita l injections from governments th us far have come as preferred shares and these have carried with them a high cost that may impair the bank s’ ability to attract other forms of private capital. consideration could be given to converting these shares into common stock so as to reduce this burden. uncertainty about further policy intervention also deters private capital, and thus clear messages to counter such uncerta inty are needed. in a systemic banking crisis, preferential treatment of new bondholders and disadvantaging previous bondholders could well be destabilizing, since many bondholders are themselves financial institutions facing stress. authorities need to be cognizant of the legal conditions un der which their intervention may be considered a “credit event,” triggering credit de rivative deliveries so as to avoid further systemic effects for other institutions or markets. cross-border cooperation and consistency is important. cross-border coordination of the principles underlying public sector decisions to provide capital injections and the conditions for such injections is crucial in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage or competitive distortions. while difficult to coordinate policies in today’s political climate, au thorities could usefully aim to provide comparisons between their proposals and others taken abroad as a way to provide more clarity. address “bad assets” systematically— asset management companies versus guarantees. given the differences in the problems faced by banking systems and the degree to which they have bad assets, vari ous approaches have been adopted. th e most important priority is to choose an appropriate approach, ensure that it is adequately funded, and implement it in a clear xiv   manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv  scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intra-european union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi   promote fiscal and financial policie s that reinforce each other. restoring credit growth is necessary to sustai n economic activity. fiscal stimulus to support economic activity and limit the degradation of asse t values should improve the creditworthiness of borrowers and the collateral underpinning loans, and combined with the financial policies to bolster banks’ balance sheets would enable sound credit extension. also, seed funds for private-public partnerships for infrastructure proj ects could raise demand for loans. for those countries where there is fiscal room to maneuver, fiscal stimulus will be looked at positively by markets, potentially helping to restore overall confidence. however, for governments already suffering large deficits or poor policymakin g institutions, the markets may be less welcoming. already, market concern at the potential fiscal co st of public support of the banking systems is evident in countries where explicit or implicit support has been provided, especially where the financial system is large compared to the economic size of the country. although there has been some improvement recently, higher government bond yields, widening credit default swap spreads, or weakening currencies are all ma nifestations of this concern. authorities should reduce their refinancing risks by lengthening their government debt maturity structure, to the extent that investor demand allows. it is clear that stimulative policies are needed now, but careful attention must be paid to the degree of fiscal sustainability and implications fo r the government’s funding needs in any stimulus package, particularly given the contingent risks to the government’s balance sheet.1 where stimulus packages suggest fiscal targets may be missed, pack ages need to be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal frameworks for lower ing deficits and debt levels.2 without such policies, governments may risk a loss in confidence in the governments’ solvency. use unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets, if needed. a number of countries have rapidly lowered nominal policy rates as their first line of defense against the recession, and some are nearing (or have already arrived at) a rate close to zero while spreads on consumer and business lending rates cont inue to be high. in some cases, unconventional central bank policies to reopen credit and funding markets have been used, and others may need to be considered. the effectiveness of additional tools is difficult to gauge so far, but it is evident that moves to expand and alter the composition of the central banks’ balance sheet are becoming more common. as central banks increasingly use such tool s, more thought should be given to appropriate exit strategies when conditions improve. govern ments may need to provide assurances both to the integrity of the central bank’s balance sheet and its overall independence. for some emerging market countries, interest rate policy in the present environment is complicated by the need to consider exchange ra te implications. some co untries may have no scope to lower rates, and may even need to raise them, if cutting rates would lead to capital outflows. as with fiscal policy, individual country circumstances will dictate how monetary policy can be used. some countries may be able to ease pressures on the exchange rates by providing foreign currency liquidity.             1see the section entitled “costs of official support, potential spillovers, and policy risks” in chapter 1; and box 3.5 in chapter 3. 2see the imf paper “the state of public finances: outlook and medium-term policies after the 2008 crisis,” march 6, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/030609.pdf . xvii setting the stage for a more robust global financial system the immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. at the same time, work is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. in addition to providing for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of direction about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and improving market confidence in the short term. while many of the propo sals below may appear conceptual, their implications are real. their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes in structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3 there is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and functioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler financial instruments than the pre-crisis period. the private sector has a cen tral responsibility to contribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to governance and remuneration policies. since neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and contain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key components to preventing future crises. the empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate systemic risks through better regulation. while attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would slow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that greater emphasis should be placed on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. at the same time, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. while we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever possible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide stability is a public good that will be undervalued by private institutions and regulations will need to force systemically important firms to better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. for this to occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. a clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear delineation of who is the lead systemic regulator. to be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be better defined and measured. chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify systemically important institutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. in some cases, the measures could be viewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” even if not formally used, the proposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order to avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. more discussion and research is needed before regulations based on this work could be put into place. as regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of regulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage and reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross-             3for a set of recommendations along these lines, see the imf paper “lessons of the financial crisis for future regulation of financial institutions and markets and for liquidity management,” february 4, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . xviii   border and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. the main lessons can be summarized as follows. define systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential regulation. as recognized by the recent g-20 communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation needs to encompass all systemically important institutions. traditionally, only a core set of large banks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis has shown that other nonbank financial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. not only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well. in order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of institutions and markets. while certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core institutions (e.g., investment banks). moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which they are placed. a two-tiered approach may work best. a wider tier would be required to provide information from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. the other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified prudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. while these institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for consumer or investor protection purposes. chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be used to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. these methods will be further explored as the imf works toward a practical definition of a systemically important institution as requested by the g-20. prevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality. new regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the subsequent and difficult deleveraging process. finding solutions for how to limit leverage going forward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation remains challenging. regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based decision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. regulation should provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and short-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not exacerbate the present situation. capital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that permit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate and are typically underestimated. this would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to capital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. ideally, these countercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and be built into regulations. this would not limit the capacity of supervisors to act with supplementary measures if needed. an upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a supplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. accounting rules and valuation practices should be strengthened to reflect a broader range of available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. accounting standard setters and prudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on enabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion, evaluating approaches xix  to valuation reserves or adjustments when valu ation of assets on the trading book are highly uncertain, and examining other ways to dampen adve rse dynamics potentially associated with fair value accounting. it is also necessary to reduce the procyclica lity of liquidity risk by taking measures to improve liquidity buffers and funding risk manageme nt. during upswings, greater attention needs to be given to funding maturity structures and th e reliability of funding sources that can prove vulnerable during downturns. address market discipline and information gaps. it is important to address the gaps in informat ion that have been revealed by the crisis. in many cases the information needed to detect system ic risks is either not collected or not analyzed with systemic risk in mind, especially those data n eeded to examine systemic linkages, as this requires information about institutions’ exposures to one another. however, in addition to some technical difficulties in collecting these data and formally measuring the exposures, there are legal impediments to their collection across different types of institutions within a country and across borders. consistency of reporting and definitions and greater information-sharing across jurisdictions are needed to begin to make headway in this area. better information is needed on off-balance-sh eet exposures, complex structured products, derivatives, leverage, and cross-bor der and counterparty exposures, supplementing the existing set of indicators used in early warning frameworks. disclosure practices should be strengthened for systemically important financial institutions, incl uding valuation methodolog ies and risk management practices, a revamped set of financial soundness indicators, and more effective assessments of systemic risk by policymakers. these elements are re inforced by the analysis in chapters 2 and 3. as well, greater availability of relia ble public information will help investors to perform proper due diligence, the failure of which was a major contributor to the present crisis. strengthen cross-border and cross-functional regulation. enhanced cross-border and cross-functiona l regulation will require improvements in institutional and legal settings. progress is need ed in reducing unnecessary differences, tackling impediments to supervision of gl obally and regionally im portant firms, with more harmonized early remedial action, bank resolution le gal frameworks, and supervisory practices to oversee cross-border firms. an appointment of a lead regulator, in principle the home authority, by the college of regulators overseeing a firm would be essential to ensure adequate oversight. home countries should endeavor to strengthen cooperation with host coun tries so as to assure lines of communication are open when rapid responses are requi red—contingency planning should involve all relevant parties. improve systemic liquidity management. in terms of systemic liquidity management, cen tral banks can learn some lessons from the crisis in terms of the flexibility of their operational frameworks, the infrastructure underlying key money markets, and the need for better mechanisms for providing cross-border liquidity. another way of limiting systemic linkages and the risks of multiple-institution distress is to provide clearing facilities that miti gate counterparty risk by netting trades and making the clearing facility a counterparty to every trade. recent attempts to provide some of these services for the credit default swap market are welcome. however, allowing a large number of proposed institutions risks diluting much-needed counterparty risk mitigation by splitting up the volumes and reducing netting opportunities. a competitive environment could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures that may compromise risk management systems. thus, if mult iple clearing facilities are permitted, they should be subject to strong oversight using globally accepted standards, ensuring the ability to clear and xx   settle across borders and in multiple currencies. box 2.4 provides the principles for their construction.  many of these recommendations have already been discussed in international fora and are forming the basis for new or altered regulation or supervisory guidance. the financial stability board, through its main working group, has estab lished a set of subgroups to provide policy guidance in a number of areas, including some of those emphasized here. the basel committee is considering changes to the basel ii framework and to its liquidity risk management framework. the international accounting standards board and the financial a ccounting standards board have both issued guidance on how to value illiquid assets and have made other alterations to their accounting guidance and standards given the crisis and its causes. othe r international organizati ons are reviewing their guidelines and best practices. for its part, the imf will be revamping its fina ncial sector assessment programs as well as improving its multilateral an d bilateral surveillance. the joint early warning exercise, conducted by the imf in cooperation with the financial stability board, will enhance the global coordination of risk assessments with the ai m of making stronger policy recommendations to prevent a buildup of systemic risks.  xxi xxii
