This comprehensive report delves into the worldwide advancements of science-based targets and reveals a remarkable ongoing surge in the adoption of science-targets by companies and financial institutions. This trend persists despite the escalating challenges prevalent on the global stage.  ',\n",
       "  'Greenstone has curated an article that captures the key insights from this report.  ',\n",
       "  'Established in 2014, The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration among organisations including CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the We Mean Business Coalition. It assists global companies and financial institutions in setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, striving for ambitious corporate climate action. The SBTi mission involves aligning businesses with climate science, cutting emissions, and contributing to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.  ',\n",
       "  'SBTi prioritises emission reduction, offering sector-specific guidance for high-emission industries and facilitating action in areas like maritime and aviation. Their approach aims to make ambitious climate action mainstream across sectors, urging the necessary transformations for a net-zero world. This includes collaboration with large companies and their supply chains. SBTi believes this multi-pronged approach will effectively accelerate private sector emissions reduction in harmony with the Paris Agreement.  ',\n",
       "  '\"SBTi Monitoring Report 2022 - Looking back at 2022 and moving forward to 2023 and beyond\" presents the major developments in the adoption of science-based targets by companies and financial institutions in the year 2022, along with updates and publications from the SBTi over the same period.  ',\n",
       "  'The data analysed in this report is up to date as of December 31, 2022. To ensure inclusiveness, information published after this date, as recent as June 2023, has been incorporated. These additional sources include company sustainability reports, corporate publications, and relevant non-financial reports accessible at the time of review.  ',\n",
       "  \"1. The adoption of science-based targets surged in 2022, surpassing the combined figures of the previous seven years. A total of 1,097 companies had validated targets published, compared to 1,082 in the preceding seven years. With 587 targets established in 2021, there was an 87% year-on-year increase in validated targets. Commitments to set science-based targets also rose, with 1,287 companies committing to this within 24 months as per the SBTi's Commitment Compliance Policy. By the close of 2022, 2,079 companies had validated science-based targets, and an additional 2,151 companies committed to setting targets.  \",\n",
       "  '2. Nearly all SBTi companies with targets are addressing scope 3 emissions. In 2022, 406 companies that set targets also included scope 3 targets. This raised the overall count of companies with science-based targets covering scope 3 (excluding SMEs and financial institutions) to 1,134, accounting for 96% by the end of 2022. Among companies that introduced scope 3 targets in 2022, 63 established supplier engagement targets, encouraging suppliers in their value chains to set their own science-based targets. Consequently, the total number of companies with supplier and customer engagement targets reached 189, equivalent to 16% of all companies with science-based targets by the conclusion of 2022.  ',\n",
       "  \"3. Companies had their targets validated against the SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard for the first full year in 2022. The Net-Zero Standard, introduced in October 2021, represents SBTi's most ambitious decarbonisation level, necessitating both near and long-term science-based targets to achieve complete emissions reduction by 2050. Of the 130 organisations that established net-zero targets in 2022, 78 (60%) were categorised as companies, with the remaining 40% being SMEs. Additionally, 889 companies committed to presenting net-zero targets. These net-zero objectives constituted 12% of all science-based targets set in 2022.  \",\n",
       "  '4. In 2022, the largest count of companies establishing targets was in Japan (201), trailed by the UK (181) and the US (109). Asia exhibited the most substantial relative expansion in companies setting targets, while Africa and Latin America also observed notable growth.  ',\n",
       "  '5. The cumulative scope 1 and 2 emissions from companies adopting science-based targets reached 422 million tonnes of CO2e by the end of 2022. This marked a significant upsurge of 27% compared to 2021 and exceeded the total greenhouse gas emissions of the UK for the same year. The combined scope 1 and 2 emissions addressed through science-based targets escalated nearly 15-fold from 145 million to two billion tonnes of CO2e between 2015 and 2022.  ',\n",
       "  '1.5°C - As of July 2022, the SBTi has only accepted new target submissions which are aligned with 1.5°C.  ',\n",
       "  '34% - By the end of 2022, companies with science-based targets or which had committed to set targets represented over a third (34%) of the global economy by market capitalisation.  ',\n",
       "  '88% - By the end of 2022, 88% of companies listed on France’s CAC Index had set or committed to set targets, compared to 70% on Germany’s DAX Index, 69% of companies on the UK’s FTSE, 43% on Italy’s MIB, 42% of all S&amp;P companies and 40% of companies listed on Japan’s NIKKEI Index.  ',\n",
       "  '58% - There was significant growth in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) setting targets, with SMEs representing the majority (58%) of organisations setting targets in 2022.  ',\n",
       "  '60% - The materials industry saw the highest growth in the number of companies setting targets. 60% of companies setting targets came from the service, manufacturing and infrastructure industries. The three lowest represented industries – power generation, biotech, healthcare and pharma, and hospitality – saw little change.  ',\n",
       "  '79% - By the end of 2022, 79% of all companies with science-based targets were 1.5°C-aligned for scopes 1 and 2.  ',\n",
       "  '76m - As of December 2022, total committed annual emissions reductions across all approved science-based targets were 76 million tonnes of CO2e, equivalent to eliminating Switzerland’s 2022 annual CO2 emissions more than twice over.  ',\n",
       "  '76% - More than three quarters (76%) of companies with science-based targets publicly reported progress against their targets in some form. More than half (53%) of companies fully reported progress on all their near-term and long-term targets in 2022, while around a quarter (23%) reported on at least one target. Half the financial institutions with science-based targets reported publicly on progress of their targets via CDP.  ',\n",

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a vital platform for organisations to transparently share their environmental data, strategies, and commitments. However, successful CDP reporting requires a year-round strategic approach that goes beyond simply meeting July disclosure deadlines. ',\n",
       "  'This article delves into five crucial practices that sustainable businesses should adopt now to ensure effective CDP reporting while fostering long-term environmental stewardship. ',\n",
       "  'Many organisations only start their CDP reporting shortly prior to the deadline and treat the disclosure as a project, but CDP reporting is an integral component of a company’s sustainability strategy. Embedding CDP reporting as part of an ongoing program will ensure that you are checking in on post-CDP actions and laying the foundations for next year’s reporting. ',\n",
       "  'This approach not only bolsters the credibility of your reporting but also cultivates an internal “culture of sustainability” within the organisation. By consistently addressing environmental concerns throughout the year, companies can seamlessly integrate sustainability practices into their operations and prepare for subsequent reporting cycles with enhanced readiness and accuracy.

       "  'Using a central sustainability reporting software platform to collect and manage ESG data enables you and your stakeholders to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to suppliers or stakeholders through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that users can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document.

Sustainability reporting software enables users to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the sustainability reporting software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate ESG performance data from across the organisation. It also enables users to run comparisons across locations, benchmark and view key information across various metrics and KPIs. ',\n",
       "  'Many companies are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to error and can be extremely heavy on time and resources. ',\n",

Using software enables users to move their focus away from just data collection and to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making. ',\n",
       "  'Meeting the scope of internal and external reporting requirements, and reporting to different stakeholders, requires a wide range of analysis tools and reporting dashboards. The right sustainability reporting software will allow you to model, apportion and compare data in a way that is relevant to your company and its stakeholders. Additionally, it should provide the option to group data into unlimited customisable sets. ',\n",

If your data isn’t organised properly or you aren’t able to effectively analyse the data you are collecting, then it is going to be a struggle for you to communicate how you measure up against your goals and strategy. With the right supporting data, it will make it much easier for you to share your stories and successes. ',\n",

However, whereas for an employee it may be communicated at a granular office level as part of a behaviour change competition related to energy savings, for suppliers, information about their contribution to the overall impact is much more valuable. Clients and consumers may care more about the environmental (e.g. CO₂, resources or natural capital) impacts of the energy consumed and shareholders/investors might want to know whether a green electricity supplier or renewable energy certificate (REC) is associated and being reported to frameworks such as CDP.

A key part of this success is having really good relationships and contacts with your suppliers. It's no good trying to send questionnaires to info@companyX because you're likely to be ignored.

For most, if not all, organisations it is essential to have a constant flow of information from their suppliers, to make sure that even legally compliant organisations are not acting in a way that introduces risk. For example, even if a supplier is legally compliant, their operations can still be affected by an increased risk of flooding (or similar). Organisations, therefore, need to understand who will hold the liability, if any disruptions occur as a result of environmental factors and have the necessary data to support this. ',\n",

This will make it easier for you to identify any potential problems with your suppliers and react to them before they become business-critical. ',\n",
       "  'It can help make life easier for your suppliers ',\n",
       "  'Imagine this situation, you’re a supplier and every single one of your customers requires its own set of data. Suddenly you have to respond to potentially hundreds of data requests. This means duplication of effort and a time-consuming, repetitive process. ',\n",
       "  'Instead, if they were using a central online repository of all information that buyers want, it would mean that suppliers can reduce the manual input needed to recreate this information. They can use this system to share information with multiple buyers. ',\n",
       "  \"Many factors continue to keep supply chain sustainability at the forefront of debate and it's important that organisations not just monitor, but account for and manage risk. Here’s how you can begin to understand the risks in your supply chain. \",\n",
       "  'What are the risks in your supply chain that you need to understand? ',\n",
       "  'This means looking at a variety of the risks that suppliers can present, including environmental and social. Companies that are reporting to various CSR frameworks, have to consider environmental impacts and\\xa0supply chain\\xa0risks. As part of CDP, for example, you report on the climate change risks for your organisation. Within GRI, you report on environmental impacts, including supplier environmental impacts and environmental assessments in the supply chain.  ',\n",
       "  \"Therefore, if your suppliers are working in countries where there are climate change risks around, say flooding, or if you're working with raw materials, and those raw materials are at threat of depletion, then that's a business risk to the organisation. But there's also an environmental impact there that needs to be considered in terms of how your suppliers interact with nature, natural capital and ecosystem services to then provide their supplier services to you. \",\n",
       "  \"There is also social pressure to consider. There are a lot of instances where companies have been in the media because of their supply chain issues, particularly in areas such as textiles and clothing. You've got organisations that have been thrown into the media spotlight around this, which has put social pressure on them to get a better handle on where their supply chain impacts are. Better than a reactionary approach to negative incidents is a process of proactive engagement with suppliers. \",\n",
       "  'How can you ensure you get relevant information from all your suppliers? ',\n",
       "  'In a lot of instances, organisations will already be asking the right questions or have most of the right questions. But because so much time is spent on gathering the information using an offline process, time to focus on the analysis of supply chain impacts is compromised. The traditional time constraints that are associated with collecting supplier information mean that organisations will tend to focus on their top-tier suppliers - the top 10 or maybe the top 20 whom they have a good relationship with. ',\n",
       "  \"But there needs to be a fundamental shift, so the process of gathering all of this information can expand to cover the whole supplier base. A key part of this success is having really good relationships and contacts with your suppliers. It's no good trying to send questionnaires to info@companyX because you're likely to be ignored. Nurturing contacts and engaging all suppliers means you can get down to those smaller suppliers that you might not have necessarily considered before and ensure that you are investigating potential risks in all parts of your supply chain. \",\n",
       "  \"This isn’t necessarily the suppliers you're spending the most money with because sometimes the organisations you are spending less with can incur more operational risk involved when you’re dealing with them. In particular, those smaller ones that you might be spending less money on, particularly SMEs, in some ways, are more likely to need help with these areas of risk. The larger players that you're spending a lot of money with, are often large buyers themselves and therefore more likely to have the internal processes in place to understand and mitigate the risk in their supply chain. \",\n",
       "  'Managing supplier relationships is no longer just about driving long term derived value from your supply chain. Companies are increasingly facing challenges that require them to proactively innovate how they manage the key stakeholders in their supply chains. In some areas, by outlasting the competition, you can grow your business significantly. No matter how big or small, it’s becoming essential for businesses to keep informed and up to date with modern standards and legislation affecting supplier management operations. ',\n",
       "  'The influence of environmental factors on supplier relationships ',\n",
       "  'As a starting point, complying with legal requirements is a minimum. For most, if not all, organisations it is essential to have a constant flow of information from their suppliers, to make sure that even legally compliant organisations are not acting in a way that introduces risk. For example, even if a supplier is legally compliant, their operations can still be affected by an increased risk of flooding (or similar). Organisations, therefore, need to understand who will hold the liability, if any disruptions occur as a result of environmental factors and have the necessary data to support this. ',\n",
       "  'External pressure on organisations ',\n",
       "  'News stories get shared faster than ever before, which can lead to an uncomfortable level of transparency for some organisations. On top of this, individual companies can be targeted by social campaigners. These are people looking to influence and change a company’s approach to its supplier management. For example, it might be that a supplier is fully compliant with local requirements, but this is a different or lower standard to one expected. As a result, the buying organisation comes under social pressure to change or reform its supplier relationship to meet the required level. ',\n",
       "  'Pressure coming from investors  ',\n",
       "  'Alongside the risks of environmental and social factors, there is growing pressure from the investor community.

       "  'In this article, the Greenstone team shares five key topics that were discussed at the event. ',\n",
       "  'During one of the keynote sessions, Dr. Sally Uren, Chief Executive at\\xa0Forum for the Future, spoke on the need for deep transformation in the world’s systems to ensure sustainability change can occur at the necessary speed and scale. As part of this transformation, Dr. Uren challenged sustainability professionals to shift their mindsets and focus on a new ambition for sustainability. ',\n",
       "  'Outlined below is the journey sustainability has taken over the years along with where it is challenged to go in order to produce just and regenerative outcomes. ',\n",
       "  \"Version 1.0: minimising negative impacts and doing less harm.Version 2.0: becoming neutral and heading to zero whilst making sure you're not doing any harm.Version 3.0: where we've been for the past few years in sustainability, which is focusing on net positive to give back into the environment more than we take out. Version 4.0: the next generation of sustainability, which is deliberate in reconfiguring the systems we depend upon to enable them to thrive in the long term. This is the new ambition that is not just focused on doing less harm, but on creating socially just, regenerative systems that thrive. \",\n",
       "  'Another topic often discussed was the difference between ESG and sustainability. Traditionally, these terms are often used interchangeably, but there are important distinctions between the two. ',\n",
       "  'The following definitions come from an\\xa0MIT article\\xa0that was shared during the conference.  ',\n",
       "  'ESG: “... is focused on screening companies for investments, largely by understanding how a business is affected by environment and social issues (with an additional focus on whether a company has good governance in place to manage those risks and pressures).” ',\n",
       "  'Sustainability: “… is a much broader idea, focusing on a company’s role in society, how it creates value by managing its environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), and how its actions affect a long range of stakeholders.” ',\n",
       "  'With the distinct definitions of ESG and sustainability in mind, attendees were challenged to think about what is lost when they focus on ESG and not on broader sustainability. With ESG being mainly focused on disclosures for investment, organizations can run the risk of losing sight of the need for actual impact. ',\n",
       "  'Some considerations to make when balancing disclosure and impacts have been outlined in more detail below. ',\n",
       "  'Investors increasingly rely on ESG raters and rankers when making decisions, but the question was posed if we have gone too far with them. While these raters and rankers can be advantageous tools, there are also disadvantages and considerations to be made: ',\n",
       "  'Advantages: ',\n",
       "  \"Sophistication - ESG raters and rankers typically use sophisticated methods to assess companies' sustainability performance, drawing on a wide range of data sources and research that can provide meaningful insights into risk and opportunities.Leadership buy-in/push - Companies may find that ESG raters and rankers can help build executive support for sustainability goals and initiatives in efforts to improve ratings and stakeholder perceptions. \",\n",
       "  'Disadvantages: ',\n",
       "  \"‘Check the box’ exercise (reporting for reporting’s sake) -ESG disclosure has the risk of becoming a box-ticking exercise, rather than a meaningful effort to drive progress on sustainability.Resource allocation - Responding to ESG raters and rankers can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for companies, particularly for smaller organisations or those with limited sustainability teams. With resources spent on disclosure, there can be little left over for implementing processes that drive sustainability.Scores that doesn’t reflect actual progress - ESG scores may not always accurately reflect a company's actual sustainability performance, and there is a risk that companies may selectively disclose information to improve their scores. \",\n",
       "  'Materiality assessments help bridge the gap between disclosure and impact in that they help inform organizations on which topics have impact and also what is important to the company’s stakeholders and investors. When looking through a\\xa0double materiality\\xa0lens, financial importance can be identified as well. ',\n",
       "  \"One potential drawback of relying too heavily on ESG raters and rankers is that it can sometimes detract from the importance of storytelling in sustainability reporting. While sustainability reporting is often focused on disclosing quantitative data and metrics, it is also important to tell the story of a company's sustainability journey, and to highlight the positive impact that it has on its stakeholders and the broader community. \",\n",
       "  'One key consideration in sustainability reporting is the tension between striving for perfection and focusing on progress. While it is important to ensure that data is accurate and complete, it is also important to remember that sustainability is a journey, and progress towards goals is ultimately what matters most. ',\n",
       "  'During the event, there was a discussion about the future of mandatory sustainability disclosures, including the\\xa0proposed rule by SEC. Currently, the\\xa0proposed rule\\xa0would require disclosure of climate-related risks, impacts, and governance processes as well as Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. Scope 3 emissions are proposed to be required if deemed material or if the company has set a GHG emissions reduction target that includes Scope 3. ',\n",
       "  'Additional insights from the discussion are shared below. ',\n",
       "  'Investors look at risk and reward – climate is a huge risk ',\n",
       "  'Extreme weather events and regulatory changes can impact the financial performance of companies. This is why investors want more information from companies to better evaluate these factors. Mandatory disclosure can provide investors with the necessary information in a standardized format to make informed investment decisions and address challenges related to climate change. ',\n",
       "  'Investments committed to Net Zero ',\n",
       "  'Over\\xa0$66 trillion in assets\\xa0are already covered by a net zero plan, indicating that many investors are working towards reducing their carbon footprint. Companies can disclose climate-related information to help investors evaluate their progress towards achieving net zero targets. This information can include emissions data and information on climate-related risks and opportunities. ',\n",
       "  'Need for comparable data in a comparable place ',\n",
       "  'Investors are calling for standardised disclosure that provides comparable data in a single location. Currently, investors are requesting different types of disclosures such as SASB, SBTi and TCFD, which can create confusion and make it difficult to compare data between companies. A standardised approach would make it easier for investors to evaluate companies and for companies themselves to provide the necessary information. ',\n",
       "  'Raters/rankers create a selective disclosure problem ',\n",
       "  'As mentioned previously, rating agencies and ranking systems can create a selective disclosure problem and reporting overload, particularly when companies are asked to report to multiple frameworks. The proposed mandatory disclosure rule by SEC has the potential to decrease the number of frameworks that companies need to report to. Instead, companies can direct investors and stakeholders to their SEC filings for the necessary information. ',\n",
       "  'Align reporting to the GHG Protocol and TCFD ',\n",
       "  'To prepare for the upcoming mandatory disclosure, companies should consider aligning their reporting with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)’s framework and with the\\xa0Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s\\xa0emissions accounting methodology as a proposed rule was modelled off them. ',\n",
       "  'Examine climate risks and opportunities ',\n",
       "  \"Companies should also take a closer look at their climate risks and opportunities and build processes to address them. This includes setting up processes to measure and report on emissions, identifying areas of improvement, and implementing solutions to reduce the company's carbon footprint. \",\n",
       "  'Scope 3 emissions emerged as a key topic\\xa0of concern during moderated sessions and networking events. We find it encouraging that sustainability professionals are all facing the challenges of Scope 3 emissions calculation and disclosure together. The reality is that no company has perfected it yet, and this is a complex issue that will require ongoing collaboration and effort to address. ',\n",
       "  'While the GHG Protocol breaks Scope 3 down into 15 categories, the most common challenges around Scope 3 with GreenBiz attendees stemmed from purchased goods and services, including supply chain engagement, and emissions associated with sold products. The following sections share additional details on these topics of concern. ',\n",
       "  'Provide tools to help suppliers/share best practices ',\n",
       "  'It is key to establish a partnership with suppliers and provide them with the necessary tools and knowledge to help them improve their sustainability practices. Sharing best practices can also be beneficial for suppliers to learn from one another and enhance their sustainability efforts. ',\n",
       "  'Make it clear why you are asking for certain information ',\n",
       "  \"To enhance supplier engagement, it's crucial to provide clarity on the purpose behind requesting specific information. Instead of simply sending out a questionnaire, companies should add some context to it, explaining why they need the information and how it will help them achieve their net-zero targets or improve their performance metrics. \",\n",
       "  'Include sustainability as a performance metric ',\n",
       "  \"By including sustainability as a performance metric, suppliers are more likely to comply with disclosing information. This can be achieved by incorporating sustainability goals and disclosure requirements into their contract language. When suppliers are held accountable for meeting these goals and disclosing information, it can increase their motivation to comply with your company's sustainability reporting requirements. \",\n",
       "  'Screen to identify hot spots ',\n",
       "  'Speakers on the subject emphasised the importance of conducting a screening to identify \"hot spots\" when assessing suppliers. This allows companies to prioritise their efforts and avoid wasting time on areas that may not be material or suppliers that are less impactful. ',\n",
       "  'Collect primary data instead of using spend-based calculation ',\n",
       "  'It was highlighted that spend-based calculations for Scope 3 emissions present challenges and limitations. While it may be a good starting point, companies should aim to focus on primary data as they progress further in their sustainability reporting journey. Without primary data, the emissions of the supplier will be viewed as standard for that category, and any innovations or emissions reductions progress they have made will not be captured.  ',\n",
       "  \"Many manufacturing companies and those that sell products in the market are placing a significant focus on life cycle analysis (LCA) and sold-product emissions. However, it's worth noting that many and organisations are still figuring out the optimal approach. Open-source LCA sites were mentioned as helpful, but if your organisation has the resources, conducting an LCA on your own products is more beneficial. Similar to the spend-based approach for suppliers, having primary data for your products is crucial, and you can then fill in any gaps as needed. \",\n",
       "  \"As mentioned, sustainability professionals are still grappling with how best to calculate Scope 3 emissions. As such, it's important to get comfortable with restatements and prepare leadership for them. It's common and often expected for data to change as enhancements in data collection and calculation are made and companies should be sure to be as transparent as possible when there are any restatements in their disclosures. \",\n",

There are multiple factors that contribute to this, such as more global supply chains, perceived efficiencies through digitisation, and the changing way in which services are delivered. ',\n",
       "  'However, the focus on managing supply chains more responsibly, or sustainably, is something that is relevant to all current and future procurement and supplier management activities. Sustainability is a key part of the evolution of procurement, and therefore needs to be fully understood and implemented. ',\n",
       "  'An estimated 70% of international trade today involves global value chains (GVCs), as services, raw materials, parts, and components cross borders – often numerous times. Once incorporated into final products they are shipped to consumers all over the world. This makes it crucial that organisations respond to an increased level of supply chain legislation, related stakeholder expectations and resultant supply chain risk. Companies are now operating in a world where company responsibility extends beyond the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) challenges of its own operations, and into far-reaching global supply chains. ',\n",
       "  'As a result, companies are increasingly seeking to create more sustainable supply chains. This is achieved by improving ESG performance throughout the supply chain, and in turn seeking to reduce costs, increase labour productivity, improve current processes, innovate and differentiate, as well as having a positive impact upon society. All these factors tend to fall under the remit of different departments within a business, which has led to the evolution of the ‘sustainable procurement’ professional.  ',\n",
       "  'This shift in the necessity for a ‘sustainable procurement’ function represents one of the greatest opportunities for business. But how does this change impact businesses? And are businesses currently structured in an appropriate way to take advantage of the opportunities available? ',\n",
       "  'A key challenge in aligning sustainability and procurement functions and practices is that until recently organisations have not necessarily been structured in such a way that facilitates alignment. The most obvious example of this is the difficulty with which organisations assign responsibility for tackling their supply chain. Even if creating more responsible supplier practices is something that is viewed as important by senior stakeholders, the roles at individual and department level do not necessarily reflect this. ',\n",
       "  'The most natural area of a business to address supply chain risk and compliance is often seen as procurement, as this is where the relationships with suppliers naturally exist. However, traditionally the success of a procurement function is determined by value and service delivery, meaning anything that diverges from this can be misunderstood or treated with scepticism. ',\n",
       "  'Conversely, the sustainability or legal and risk teams within an organisation are well placed from a knowledge perspective to assess suppliers on relevant metrics, gauge compliance and satisfy reporting requirements. They are not however best placed to leverage supplier relationships or apply their knowledge to the supplier selection processes. ',\n",
       "  'The increased scrutiny on supply chains represents operational, financial, regulatory and reputational risks to an organisation. Businesses tend to be risk driven, and when faced with such risks involve the relevant operational and knowledge bases within the company to address them. ',\n",
       "  'Addressing supply chain risk, and in turn creating more responsible supply chains, should be no different. An integrated approach is required to embed sustainability into the operations of the company. To achieve this the criteria upon which suppliers are assessed need to combine both sustainability and traditional metrics, such as price and quality. This more holistic approach should not just be applied to the supplier selection process, but also form an integral part of ongoing supplier assessment and performance review. ',\n",
       "  'How to successfully adopt a more integrated approach depends on the structure of the organisation. Creating a sustainable procurement function that sits between sustainability and procurement, providing a link between the subject matter experts, is just one way.

       "  'An important area of discussion was net-zero goals. Although net-zero goals are not a new trend, many corporations have now set specific science-based targets and are making significant progress towards achieving them. With the progress, many companies discussed reaching an inflexion point where they have reduced their carbon footprint as much reasonably possible. This inflexion point leads them to consider offsets and removals. Attendees were challenged to use offsets only when necessary and to focus on innovation until the last minute. ',\n",

       "  'The reasons behind greenhushing can include avoiding backlash from those opposed to climate action, not wanting to be called out for falling short of their targets, or hiding any instances of greenwashing. Greenhushing is cause for concern as it hinders progress towards achieving sustainability goals and puts companies at odds with their stakeholders. ',\n",
       "  'It is important for companies to find a balance between disclosure and action. They must avoid reporting for solely the sake of reporting and engaging in greenwashing or greenhushing.

The report highlights that human-caused climate change is already having severe impacts on vulnerable people and ecosystems worldwide, as the Earth is warming faster than previously thought. However, there is still time to take effective action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. ',\n",
       "  'Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: ',\n",
       "  \"The report highlights the urgent need for deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reduction as crucial to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is essential to take immediate and decisive action to reduce emissions across all sectors, including transportation, energy production, and agriculture. The findings of the report reinforce the need for global cooperation and decisive action to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change and protect our planet's future. The window of opportunity to take meaningful action is rapidly closing, and it is crucial that we act now to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come. \",\n",
       "  'The burning of fossil fuels, coupled with unsustainable energy and land use, has led to a global warming of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature has resulted in more frequent and intense extreme weather events, leading to increasingly dangerous impacts on both nature and people in every region of the world. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more severe droughts, and devastating wildfires, among other things. The urgent need to transition away from high polluting energy and fuel cannot be overstated, as the continued use of unsustainable practices will only exacerbate these problems. We must view the transition to decarbonised forms of energy not only as a positive but an urgent necessity. ',\n",
       "  \"Climate justice is a critical issue, as those who have contributed the least to climate change are being impacted the most. Additionally, nearly half of the world's population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change, which only exacerbates the issue. The key to solving this problem lies in climate-resilient development, which involves incorporating measures to adapt to climate change while simultaneously working to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in ways that provide broader benefits. Climate-resilient development is crucial as it helps communities to better prepare for and withstand the effects of climate change while simultaneously working towards a more sustainable future. \",\n",
       "  \"Political commitment, coordinated policies, international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship, and inclusive governance are all crucial for achieving effective and equitable climate action. To combat climate change, it is essential to implement policies that promote sustainable development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural ecosystems. International cooperation is vital to ensure that all countries work together towards a common goal. Additionally, ecosystem stewardship, including the conservation of approximately 30-50% of the Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans, is crucial for ensuring a healthy planet. This requires inclusive governance that ensures the participation of all stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples. By prioritising effective and equitable climate action, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for all. \",\n",

While regulatory disclosure was not a motivator, 60% of respondents believe that compliance scope 3 reporting will be required in the future. However, data access is a significant barrier to developing a robust baseline, with limited supplier data being a primary issue. In addition, companies face challenges such as limited time and resources, interpretation of GHG accounting standards, and low comparability of baselines between peers. 70% of organisations have re-baselined their emissions in the last five years, 50% of which have been due to methodological changes. ',\n",
       "  'Despite the inclusion of scope 3 commitments in 96% of validated science-based targets, 90% of respondents believe that the process for setting a scope 3 science-based target is challenging. Companies experience difficulties with low confidence in their ability to deliver scope 3 decarbonisation due to perceived consequences of failure and the maturity of delivery roadmaps. Additionally, a lack of target-setting methods tailored to company circumstances is a barrier, including sector specificity and accounting for growth. Respondents also cited unclear or ambiguous SBTi requirements, weak or unknown business cases, and a lack of understanding amongst company decision-makers as challenges for target setting. ',\n",

Respondents identified emissions in scope 3 cat. 1, purchased goods and services, and scope 3, cat. 11, use of sold products as the most challenging to decarbonise. The top three challenges for target delivery include the ability to influence upstream suppliers, cost of decarbonisation, and the ability to track progress towards a target due to insufficient access to primary data.

       "  'Having a sustainability and ESG reporting software solution that is intuitive and easy to use, particularly for first-time users, is very important. If a system is intuitive and easy to navigate, you’ll get people using it quickly and ultimately engaging with your sustainability initiatives. Unlimited restrictions on user profiles will ensure each person’s access gives them exactly what they need. ',\n",
       "  'Another thing to consider is whether the sustainability reporting software solution integrates with other systems.

       "  'Sustainability reporting isn’t just the responsibility of the sustainability department anymore; it’s on the agenda and requires the collaboration of many different stakeholders. In particular, investors are starting to demand information on sustainability, ESG and exposure to climate risk. ',\n",
       "  'When selecting sustainability reporting software, you’ll need to consider whether the analytic tools and reporting available will fit the reporting requirements of all of your stakeholders. It’s also important to consider whether it will give you the results from your data that will help you engage with different audiences and help you make better-informed business decisions. ',\n",
       "  'Understanding the implementation process, and the timelines involved, in your selected sustainability and ESG reporting software is important. Not only so you know what to expect and what you need to prepare, but to ensure your selected software provider has the appropriate training and roll-out plans in place. For example, the number of upfront training days to get your team up to speed on the software is something to consider. And, if you think the number of days is unreasonably high, maybe you should question the usability of the solution.  ',\n",
       "  'If you are transitioning from another system, it’s also useful to find out how the transition is managed and how continuity risk is minimised. For example, will both systems run alongside each other to avoid any downtime? ',\n",
       "  'As ESG reporting requirements increase, so does the volume and scope of data that you need to manage. When selecting software, think about whether the solution will evolve with your reporting requirements and adapt to your changing organisational structure in years to come.  ',\n",
       "  'Sustainability reporting software takes investment in time and resources to implement so you need to be sure that the solution has the capability and innovation to grow with you.

Although I am based in the US, my team’s role is inherently global. ',\n",
       "  'I joined the company in 2019 (when we were Viacom and then ViacomCBS) and ESG was something we knew was important as we re-merged Viacom and CBS – and we were quite early in our strategy journey. So, for the past three years, my team and I have been building out an ESG strategy that is grounded in reliable data and what is material to our business. My day-to-day role is really about finding opportunities for efficiency, clarity, further environmental responsibility and what resources we need to take them forward. ',\n",
       "  'Our ESG strategy is critical to our success as a company. We work to foster a better world for our employees, audiences, partners, and communities as Paramount.

Paramount has a legacy of delivering content that explores and celebrates diversity and inclusivity. We are constantly building on this legacy with programming that centres diverse voices while taking on the issues relevant to those communities. ',\n",
       "  'On the environmental side, as a global media company, we are not a major emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to some other industries. However, we cannot separate ourselves from the growing need for collective action. Our environmental strategy is focused on continuing to understand and mitigate environmental impacts across our company and value chain, and to use our content platforms to further raise awareness and inspire global action in response to the climate crisis. ',\n",
       "  'We are relatively early in our journey of telling our ESG story; and started by publishing our first company-wide ESG report in 2019–2020.

       "  \"Before coming to Paramount, I consulted for companies at every stage of the ESG and sustainability journey. Many companies just starting out in reporting often believe they need to have perfect answers before they can make a CDP submission. But really, CDP reporting is a tool – and it’s important to start wherever you are and establish a baseline for disclosure and evaluation. Many companies are still developing their climate change strategies and reporting to CDP is an important catalyst to help drive a company’s ongoing journey forward. Focusing on the topics that are material to the company is a good place to start. By demonstrating that you're engaging with the process, even with room for improvement, you can help strengthen your company’s reputation in sustainability. Transparency is key. \",\n",
       "  'CDP also helps us figure out where to focus our reporting efforts.

       "  'I don’t mean to downplay the effort it takes to report against CDP and other key reporting frameworks – but the clarity into your own impact areas and progress gained from the process is essential. ',\n",
       "  'We’re a team driven by the data. It helps us stay focused on what is material and relevant for our company while also helping us ensure that we’re using our own internal resources appropriately – focusing on what matters most. It’s crucial for us as the ESG team to have access to reliable and consistent data to be able to report performance and set targets with confidence. That’s where our partnership with Greenstone comes in.

There is no doubt that it was a significant year for business and ESG and we anticipate that 2023 will be no different, with greater demand for transparency and accountability. Below we have highlighted five key ESG reporting trends to look out for in 2023. ',\n",
       "  'For businesses, mandatory regulation on ESG reporting is coming in thick and fast, both in the EU and in the United States. ',\n",
       "  'In the EU, the\\xa0Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\\xa0is the latest EU Regulation regarding ESG and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero. It is a step up from the current EU Regulation the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding the number of mandatory reporting companies from 11,600 to around 49,000. ',\n",
       "  'The US is poised for regulation too. The\\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure rule\\xa0will launch in 2023 if approved. In March 2022, the SEC released a new proposal for public companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results. It requires all filers to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions that occur onsite and are controlled by the company. ',\n",
       "  'As ESG performance becomes a greater focus in the boardroom, companies are having to consider how best to hold themselves accountable. One way to accomplish this is to tie leaders’ compensation to positive ESG outcomes. Companies are increasingly including ESG metrics of some type in their incentive compensation schemes for top executives. ',\n",
       "  'In some companies, ESG and sustainability responsibility lies with the full board. Others assign diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) and human capital management issues to the human resources committee and sustainability oversight to audit or governance committees. The exact assignments will vary with each company’s specific needs and culture, but it is becoming critical to assign accountability and ensure sufficient governance oversight within a board. ',\n",
       "  'Corporate board demographics are changing too. Companies are now looking to assemble boards for ‘tomorrow’, today. For example, recruiting ESG expertise on the board has become critical and hiring has a DE&amp;I lens now more than ever. ',\n",
       "  'At the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP) in 2022, there was an emerging theme of natural capital and the need to prioritise the preservation of biodiversity. The risks resulting from a loss of nature and changes to natural capital have the potential to disrupt society and the stability of the global economy. Whilst most research on financial risks related to natural capital has historically focused on climate change, there is a growing awareness of the risks associated with other aspects of natural capital, such as water stresses, resource scarcity and the loss of biodiversity. ',\n",
       "  'Biodiversity-related corporate reporting\\xa0is a fast-moving, developing area, and there is ongoing work to create harmonisation, particularly related to measurement and disclosure. Companies should not wait for globally agreed frameworks or perfect tools to be available to approach the topic of biodiversity and nature. Companies should begin to understand and manage biodiversity and nature-related risk and opportunities and to prepare to respond to the introduction of frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). ',\n",
       "  'With more regulation and investor pressure, there is no doubt that companies will need a process to produce high-quality, defensible ESG data that is more aligned with financial reporting requirements. ',\n",
       "  'For investors, a company’s ESG performance is only as good as its data quality. Bad quality data can result in inaccurate reporting, lack of transparency, and potential backlash from stakeholders if your efforts are deemed unreliable. Demanding data transparency is the way investors can ensure that the ESG information provided is accurate and not misleading. ',\n",
       "  'Advances in technology and software solutions to enable in-depth ESG data analysis are increasing the expectations for ESG data quality and transparency. Once good quality primary data is collected, software solutions enable ESG performance data to be aggregated, compared and benchmarked across various global metrics, KPIs and frameworks.  ',\n",
       "  'The reporting of Scope 3 emissions (GHG emissions that are not produced directly from the reporting company but from the activities of its value chain), will continue to rise, and will continue to be a challenging area for many. Communication, collaboration and shared-goals are key to achieving successful Scope 3 disclosure. However, even if you have a high level of buy-in both up and down the value chain, there are still complexities around the data itself and the methodologies used to calculate emissions. ',\n",
       "  'Leveraging Scope 3 resources to understand where your material impacts lie, where to start with data collection and how to focus on data quality and coverage over time, will ensure that a journey to reliable Scope 3 data is followed. ',\n",
       "  'In summary, what does this mean for businesses and ESG-focused investors? For both groups, requirements to collect, assess and report quality primary ESG data will continue to grow in 2023 and beyond so now is the time to ensure you have future-proof data management processes in place. As the ESG and sustainability reporting landscape grows in complexity and becomes increasingly mainstream, there is a real opportunity for business to improve transparency and demonstrate leadership. Those who don’t address ESG performance – whether it’s across their own operations, their supply chains or their investment portfolio - face getting left behind. ',\n",

       " ['Greenstone attended the recent Responsible Investment Forum in London. Co-hosted with PRI, the Responsible Investment Forum is the longest-running private equity (PE) event focused on bringing together fund managers, institutional investors, and expert advisors to discuss ESG issues across alternative asset classes. ',\n",
       "  'Below we identify four key themes during the event: ',\n",
       "  'ESG continues to be high on the agenda for PE markets. Many general partners (GPs) are increasingly subject to higher scrutiny and regulatory compliance in an ever-evolving landscape. There is now much more emphasis on creating value through ESG performance, and a step away from the notion of ‘not doing harm’. ',\n",
       "  'Although PE firms are uniquely placed to realise ESG opportunities as a key value creation driver, the journey can be challenging and complex. The multiplicity of ESG frameworks, and obtaining reliable data to track performance, remain a challenge. However, as the industry matures, tools are being developed and ‘preferred’ frameworks are being adopted to align expectations. ',\n",
       "  'GPs can protect and create long-term value by enhancing value levers and integrating ESG into their value creation plans. Measuring performance against targets and building the knowledge and technology to support and improve those KPIs are key to the success, and sustaining asset value. ',\n",
       "  'A growing number of firms are developing decarbonisation strategies and many have set net-zero commitments and science-based targets across their portfolio. For these firms, defining a decarbonisation strategy is the most important starting point. Such a strategy typically involves setting out the overarching ambition and articulating carbon reduction targets, which can be broken down into short- and long-term measures. It is critical to align these targets with the firm’s overall ESG and fund strategy, serving as a guide for limited partners (LPS) and the investment team. ',\n",
       "  'However, setting realistic and achievable targets requires accurate measurement of primary data. This requires a streamlined approach to data collection and analysis, as well as portfolio engagement and education. PE firms need to truly engage with their portfolio companies’ management teams and set a clear roadmap. With active engagement at portfolio level, LPs can ensure that these portfolio companies feel part of their investor’s decarbonisation journey and understand what is expected of them year-on-year. ',\n",
       "  'Accurate and reliable ESG data is crucial to ensuring firms achieve their targets and create value. This not only relates to decarbonisation and the need for accurate emissions data, but is also true for the entire ESG spectrum. Primary data, sourced directly from portfolio companies, is how reliable value creation can be achieved. Anything else: secondary, or tertiary publicly available data, won’t stand up to scrutiny when it comes to monitoring the progress of targets and performance over time. ',\n",
       "  'To report robust and relevant data, LPs need to consider implementing a data strategy that future-proofs their reporting objectives. Embedding a data strategy will enable organisations to define a clear path for data management, facilitate reporting resilience, engage stakeholders, embrace technology and balance short- and long-term reporting effectively. ',\n",
       "  'As with any data request, it is essential to communicate what is required clearly but also expand on the when, how and why. Portfolio companies will look to investors for guidance on what is required today, but they also need to understand the context of the broader journey. For many privately held companies, they may not have been required to report on environmental or carbon data previously and as such, an educational element to their engagement is important. ',\n",
       "  'A challenge within the PE industry is the concept of letting perfection get in the way of progress. Stakeholders need to understand that perfection isn’t achieved overnight. ',\n",
       "  'ESG data is a great starting point and it’s important to have a baseline in order to monitor progress but we’re already seeing signs of ‘greenhushing’ where companies choose to keep their efforts quiet for fear of being accused of greenwashing. While there is a place for blatant greenwashing being exposed, more needs to be done to encourage companies to do their best to improve. ',\n",
       "  'ESG and sustainability reporting is a journey and the key to success is measurement of progress and stakeholder buy-in. CEOs and Boards need to be genuinely committed to the goals and need to be educated and informed at every step of the way. ',\n",
       "  'ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process. Investors are looking for purpose-built ESG software platforms to collect, track and analyse data and material ESG KPIs from their portfolios on an ongoing basis. ',\n",
       "  'Greenstone has been providing sustainability and ESG software solutions for 15+ years. Through its award-winning InvestorPortal software solution, focused on the collection, management and analysis of ESG and carbon data across an investment portfolio, Greenstone is enabling global PE firms to measure the ESG and carbon impact of their portfolios.

The event took place at a resort in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6th\\xa0to the 18th. It brought together over 30,000 policymakers, activists, and scientists with the goal of pushing global and national commitments toward a more sustainable future. ',\n",
       "  'The event was split into Thematic Days to provide more focus on an extremely broad topic and agenda. The days included Finance Day, Science Day, Youth &amp; Future Generations Day, Decarbonisation Day, Adaptation &amp; Agriculture Day, Gender Day, Water Day, Ace &amp; Civil Society Day, Energy Day, Biodiversity Day, and Solutions Day. The inclusion of a Youth &amp; Future Generations Day was a novel idea acknowledging that youth play the smallest role in developing climate action plans but will suffer the largest consequences if developed plans are inadequate. ',\n",
       "  'In this article, we will consolidate the most relevant events from the different days of COP27 for businesses to consider as 2022 ends and they prepare for a more climate-focused future in 2023 and beyond. The conversations at COP27 can help predict what areas of sustainability will be given the most attention in the coming year and therefore provide important guidance for companies to stay ahead of industry trends. Some important themes from COP27 with implications on business include loss and damage financing, the rejection of greenwashing, the need for a higher carbon price, the rise of offsets, and a focus on biodiversity. ',\n",
       "  '  ',\n",
       "  'On Monday, November 7th, the first day of the conference, delegates added the issue of \"loss and damage\" to the official summit agenda. Delegates hoped to discuss climate reparations to developing nations given their high vulnerability to climate impacts but low contribution to historical greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of the conference, the first-ever global agreement calling for climate reparations was established. The specifics of how this fund will operate will be laid out at COP28 next year in the United Arab Emirates. When diving into the text in detail, activists note the inclusion of “low-emission” energy as part of the solution. Some may worry this provides a loophole for natural gas and nuclear energy to continue to grow. Nevertheless, the creation of this agreement is a landmark achievement and will result in significant climate-dedicated cash flows to vulnerable nations. ',\n",
       "  'The structure of how climate reparations will work will not be set until next year. Therefore, businesses have a year to prepare in anticipation of next year’s COP28 agreement. Businesses can capitalise on the subsequent sustainability opportunities in previously underfunded countries. This agreement could open novel markets for companies in infrastructure, manufacturing, capital goods, and more for expansion and business development. With large sums of cash flowing to previously underfunded regions, companies may find new opportunities in regions not previously anticipated. ',\n",
       "  'On Tuesday, November 8th, the UN released a report about greenwashing and its widespread impacts on successful climate action. The UN provides a list of recommendations to ensure developed net zero pledges do not fall for greenwashing pitfalls. An example of one recommendation is the need to establish short- and medium-term absolute emissions reduction targets in addition to ones focused on the long term. Without targets for varying timelines, it is easy to develop unachievable long-term goals. Incremental work ensures companies and local governments continue to push themselves and do not forget about their plans for too long. ',\n",
       "  'The release of this report is a reminder that successful climate action requires reliable data to develop reliable plans and set realistic targets. Unreliable data and unrealistic goals provide short-sighted benefits but are extremely detrimental in the long term as companies and local governments try to undo false promises. Only those with legitimate emissions reductions will get to benefit from the positive publicity as governments crack down on greenwashing. Greenwashing is unlikely to be fully quashed any time soon, but in light of COP27, we suggest reviewing your climate goals to ensure they are ambitious but achievable to prevent false promises down the line. ',\n",
       "  'We all know inflation is on the rise. However, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the price of carbon also needs to see a significant rise. The IMF says that the carbon price must go up to at least $75/ton by 2030 for global climate goals to succeed. Timely for the European Union, they already established a benchmark price at about 76 euros/tonne. However, the EU is unique in its resolve as the US state of California has carbon allowances selling for just under $30/tonne and many regions have yet to establish a price at all. ',\n",
       "  'A carbon price can be established in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Although different in their design and implementation, both follow a structure that forces the original polluter to pay. Businesses that do not reduce their carbon emissions will feel the financial consequences as more regions implement these systems. Getting ahead of regulation is a smart strategy to prevent headaches and unnecessary taxes in the future. We recommend beginning the greenhouse gas accounting journey to start reducing emissions in advance of expensive regulation. ',\n",
       "  'During Finance Day, John F. Kerry, the White House climate envoy, outlined the USA’s carbon trading scheme. The voluntary plan aims to expand the sale of carbon credits globally to help boost renewable energy implementation in developing countries. The “Energy Transition Accelerator” will allow companies to claim credits for decarbonisation projects outside national borders and within developing countries. ',\n",
       "  'While the plan faced some backlash, its implementation could open opportunities for US companies to focus on clean energy as a means to offset necessary emissions of operations. Broadening beyond the US’s scheme, this COP saw a rise in the legitimacy of offsets. Offsets were pushed aside in past years to focus on other strategies. However, people noted a significant increase in offset conversations throughout COP27. Offset and renewable energy projects can help offset a company’s internal emissions or be sold to other organisations falling short. ',\n",
       "  'Although the 27th\\xa0UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change wrapped up this past weekend, the UN’s involvement in sustainability-related conversations is not complete for the year. The UN is hosting COP15, the UN Biodiversity Conference, in Montreal this December. On Wednesday, November 16th, Biodiversity Day of COP27, 350 civil society leaders called on heads of state to prioritise the upcoming event. ',\n",
       "  'Nature and biodiversity are becoming key sustainability issues of attention. Companies and governments need to respond and report to relevant frameworks. We see companies increasingly beginning to report on standards and frameworks beyond climate. For example, in 2021 the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) announced a new initiative called the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The framework was tested this year and is scheduled to officially launch in 2023. TNFD mimics the structure of TCFD with the intention to help companies and local governments report on the risks associated with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. We see businesses work towards biodiversity reporting to stay on top of sustainability trends. ',\n",
       "  '  ',\n",
       "  'The end of COP27 boasts many exciting successes as well as evident shortcomings. Regardless of your perspective of the size of its impact, COP27, like all of the COPs before it, will push companies and governments in specific areas they hadn’t previously intended. COP27 was another step in highlighting the crucial need for delivery on climate action. ',\n",
       "  'Based on speeches of political leaders and reports presented, a world of climate related-regulation is coming into clearer focus. Global enforcement is not coming anytime soon but specific nations and regions are setting ambitious goals for themselves. Businesses can prepare for regulation in their operating regions today by beginning their GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reporting journey if they haven’t already. However, before diving into reducing a business’s emissions, a company needs a solid grasp of how much they are emitting and where it is originating. ',\n",

Once collected, you are then faced with the daunting task of combining datasets from different business functions into something that can be interpreted, analysed and reported on. ',\n",
       "  'As data gets more complex, using spreadsheets becomes cumbersome and there is a point where spreadsheets simply cannot handle the volume of data you need to report as part of your sustainability and ESG strategy. ',\n",
       "  'Greenstone, through its award-winning sustainability and ESG software, enables its clients to move away from spreadsheet outputs and time-consuming data collection; to in-depth reporting and analysis and real decision-making. Based on our experience of helping our clients do this, below we have outlined five reasons why spreadsheets are not fit to manage your sustainability data. ',\n",
       "  'It is likely that you will be dealing with large volumes of sustainability and ESG data collected from a long list of sources across your organisation. Putting all this data into a single spreadsheet can be a problem as Excel struggles with large file sizes. Whilst you can enter large volumes of data into Excel, you will find yourself waiting for ages for it to perform even the simplest calculations and the files can be unstable and can easily crash. ',\n",
       "  'Another factor that will affect the performance of your spreadsheet is the number of formulas and conditional formatting you use. As the complexity of your sustainability and ESG reporting increases with larger and larger datasets, you will find your formula-rich spreadsheets performing very slowly and eventually crashing. ',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'One of the most limiting factors when using spreadsheets to manage your sustainability and ESG data is the lack of multiple user access options. Excel was never built for multiple users and even with modern versions, it is completely impractical to have more than a limited number of users access a spreadsheet at once. Even with a small number of users accessing a single file at one time, there is an increased danger of data loss. ',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'Excel can produce a number of reports, graphs and charts but they are limited and can easily become detached from automatic updates without clear indication. Sustainability and ESG software can automatically produce reports for internal reporting purposes, as well as global ESG and sustainability reporting frameworks e.g. CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD, DJSI and ISO, at the click of a button. ',\n",
       "  'The same goes for dashboards; Excel doesn’t come with dashboards, whereas sustainability management software comes packed with a variety of intuitive and customisable dashboards that multiple stakeholders within an organisation, whether software users or not, can access and easily understand. ',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'Excel spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to other software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service provides daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention. ',\n",

Examples of this include industry-specific calculations, such as parallel GHG calculations across location-based, residual-mix and market-based emissions reporting coming as standard functionality. In Excel, you’ll have to build all this functionality into your spreadsheet yourself, which can take quite a lot of work and a good degree of training to use. ',\n",

       "  'One of the most common questions asked by organisations engaging their suppliers for the first time, is “who should I target?”. Well firstly, it is worth reviewing and understanding your supplier list. It can become apparent with a deeper look that a supplier list is not up to date and accurate, many listed suppliers are no longer suppliers and from our experience, the actual list is anywhere between 40 – 70 % smaller. This makes an enormous difference when planning your approach, as we would always argue that from a risk perspective you need almost the entire supplier coverage. ',\n",

       "  'We have multiple clients who distribute their supplier code of conduct through SupplierPortal. These are mandated for all suppliers, and so there is really no reason why you should not be looking to achieve basic compliance across all of your suppliers. Sadly, the risk to your business is unlikely to conveniently sit within 20% of suppliers that represent 80% of your spending. Therefore, you need to avoid a lack of meaningful coverage, and if you do try a different approach then don’t take a simple cross-section of suppliers but apply geographical, legislative and spend filters to identify ‘high’ risk suppliers. Always think is your approach well thought through and defensible to an auditor. ',\n",

       "  'Whilst identifying who your suppliers are and what categories they sit in, you also need to understand what it is you are going to ask them. The information you require from a supplier will undoubtedly be linked to their geography and the service they provide and as a result of these, the legislation or certification requirements that apply. If correctly distributed to suppliers, your data sets should be relevant and therefore be comparable within your supplier categories. You should also be careful not to ask for any information that you will not use. The content can and will evolve over time, so there is no need to overburden a supplier in phase one of your strategy.

You need to engage individual suppliers in dialogue on the risks that have been identified, create an action plan, set deadlines, and track the remediation process. As with the identification of risk, this is a process that consumes huge amounts of resources if it cannot be automated. Once again the capacity to do this effectively is increased by good planning around what information is gathered from which suppliers, and clearly identifying what constitutes a risk. ',\n",

       "  'The key risk of not having an ongoing process in place is that the data evolves. Supplier responses change over time and you need to be aware of this, time-critical documentation can expire, and new suppliers, come on board and need to be put through the same review process. All of this requires a continual review of the data and ideally automated notification when new exceptions occur. ',\n",
       "  'However, perhaps one of the key risks is new legislation. The risk is twofold. Either you are unaware of the legislation which opens up a clear issue of compliance, or your process is not flexible enough to accommodate changes in content, supplier responses and so on. ',\n",
       "  'Without a clear understanding of the status of your suppliers at any given time, the potential for risks to go undetected increases exponentially.

       "  'Identification of relevant suppliers ',\n",
       "  \"When starting supplier ESG programmes, it's often necessary to identify relevant or material suppliers. Procurement is key to this process and may be asked to provide supplier data sets that can support and inform the process.

Therefore, it is important that supplier contracts reference ESG and disclosure requirements. These agreements are a key mechanism in achieving high levels of supplier engagement. Conversely, existing agreements may also impact the type of approach you can take with certain suppliers in terms of addressing ESG. Overall, procurement is likely to be responsible for reviewing existing agreements, updating contracts and ensuring that they get put in place with suppliers. ',\n",
       "  '  ',\n",
       "  'Another way in which procurement is impacted by the increasing need for ESG reporting in supply chain is through the interactions within an organisation.

Even within an organisation’s supply chain, deploying different calculation approaches can provide accuracy in categories where emissions are greatest and reduce the resource required in others.

For example, supplier emissions that are calculated solely on spending associated with purchased goods and services can only be reduced by reducing this spending. ',\n",

It is clear that the regular disclosure of emissions and reductions plans is here to stay. While some of the new reports required by the SEC may not be due until 2024, many companies aren’t waiting to get started. Many investors are asking for the climate data now, and companies that have it and can manage it easily with software – such as Greenstone’s enterprise product - will both be able to answer those questions and get a head start on what’s to follow. ',\n",
       "  'This new ruling will help to centralise climate risks in decision making for companies and is driven by the demands of shareholders and investors for companies to consider climate reporting as a smart business decision. If you are a public company, you’ll need to start preparing to meet the proposed SEC disclosure requirements. But keep in mind that even if you have a private company, you’re competing against public companies who will need to meet these new requirements, in a marketplace that increasingly expects ESG disclosures from businesses. Therefore, while the takeaways mostly apply to public companies, all companies should give them strong consideration. ',\n",
       "  'Get organised. Your company may already be conducting an internal analysis of their GHG emissions and their materiality to business or may have publicly announced GHG reduction goals. If so, you already have a good foundation to build on to facilitate public sharing of metrics and details they already track internally. ',\n",

However, it is advised that you check whether your current Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions boundary, as well as your Scope 3 emissions, includes all entities in your consolidated financial statements. This will help to future-proof your footprint and better align it with your financial reporting. ',\n",

Third-party attestation auditing requirement will phase in over two years, and will only apply to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers. This report should also include related disclosures about the attestation service provider. We see this as \"limited\" assurance of the ESG information being disclosed, which is less strict than a financial audit, but still requires working with a sustainability reporting partner organisation.

If adopted, the rules will then go through a phase-in period that would require disclosures in filings made as early as 2024 for information in the 2023 fiscal year. The expectation is that the rule will pass in 2022, and be applied for 2023 (and beyond) reporting years. ',\n",

As scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned by the company, one company’s scope 3 emissions may originate from another company’s scope 1, Scope 2 or even scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are split between 15 categories including Category 15: Investments. ',\n",
       "  'In order to calculate the emissions from Scope 3, Category 15 (Investments), there are two overarching methodologies: ',\n",
       "  'Investment-specific method: This method involves collecting scope 1 and 2 emissions (and scope 3 when “significant”) from the investee company and allocating the emissions based upon the share of investment. ',\n",

To build a sustainable long-term investment strategy that will support investment decisions, investors need access to current and correct data for both now and in the future – not just a time-stamped data set.  ',\n",
       "  'Using a central software platform to collect and manage the ESG performance data of portfolio companies enables investors to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to portfolio companies through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that investors can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document. Scoring of portfolio companies also ensures that year on year improvements can be realised and minimum performance thresholds can be met. ',\n",
       "  '  ',\n",
       "  'Access to accurate and consistent ESG data to enable responsible investment decisions is now more important than ever. There is a plethora of ESG frameworks and guidelines available for ESG reporting but, for investors, working out which ESG metrics to request from companies is challenging. Before seeking data, investors need to be sure that that data will reliably support their investment decisions and accurately enable their long-term sustainability strategy. ',\n",
       "  'ESG software enables investors to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate ESG performance data from across funds and portfolios. It also enables investors to compare, benchmark and score portfolio companies and view key information across various metrics and KPIs. ',\n",

       "  'Many firms are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to risk and error and are extremely heavy on time and resources. ',\n",
       "  'Through the use of software, data collection, management and reporting can all be automated, on a large scale, which leaves investors more time for analysis. Using software enables investors to move their focus away from just data collection and on to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making. ',\n",

       " ['One of the most publicised and immediate impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic was and still is, the impact on supply chains. Everything impacted supply chains - from the restrictions being placed on the movement of people and the ways in which goods could be transported, to the human impact of the virus that meant it became more challenging to produce goods and deliver services. ',\n",
       "  'These short-term impacts, or supply chain shocks, required ingenuity and resilience to resolve; to ensure that global supply chains functioned sufficiently well to support communities and commerce. This has led to very rapid changes in the way that suppliers are managed, coupled with the repurposing of existing management tools and practices to align with the new stresses and strains placed upon people, companies and interconnected supply chains. ',\n",
       "  'Sustainable procurement, or responsible sourcing, was increasingly coming to the fore in the years prior to the pandemic. How organisations align their purchasing practices with their overarching corporate sustainability goals is a key factor in a meaningful sustainability programme. The pandemic has shone a light on the relationship between strong sustainability performance and resilience, and it is with this in mind that we see the opportunities to ‘build back greener’ touted across large parts of the economy. It is clear that more responsible and sustainable supply chains will be key to achieving the goal of building back better. ',\n",
       "  'In this article, we look at what the short-term impacts of COVID-19 have been on supply chains, how we have seen supplier management practices pivot to face these challenges and what the longer-term outlook might be and what opportunities this represents. ',\n",
       "  'According to\\xa0McKinsey, 73% of executives said they had encountered problems in their supply base as a result of COVID-19. The immediate and most obvious impact of COVID-19 on these supply chains was that of supply. There were clear increases in demand for certain products due to consumer concern about supply. This exacerbated real issues that were arising throughout the supply chain and leading to actual supply stress, resulting in a positive feedback loop that deepened the problem. ',\n",
       "  'Some issues that contributed to constricted supply were related to confusion and a lack of understanding of the virus itself. Meaning that cross-border flows of goods stalled due to safety precautions needing to be understood and then implemented, and local ‘lockdown’ regulations needing to be understood in relation to trade, before the flow of goods from origin could continue. ',\n",
       "  'The above example can clearly be applied to food supply chains. However, COVID-19 impacts extend beyond just food and have the potential to impact the supply of any type of physical good, which in turn can affect all business sectors including our clients across professional and financial services. This is borne out by the fact that\\xa094% of Fortune 1000 companies are seeing coronavirus supply chain disruptions. ',\n",
       "  'The interconnectedness of supply chains, whilst proving a blessing in the modern world, was very quickly shown to be a weakness if they were not fully understood by the actors throughout them. ',\n",
       "  'Similarly, applicable across all sectors was the importance of supplier resilience. This relates to multiple aspects of a supplier’s business, ranging from financial stability and governance to the type of service or good they supply, and where that is itself created and delivered. This is why the link between good sustainability, or ESG performance, and resilience has been made. ',\n",
       "  'Sustainability, or ESG, covers a wide range of performance metrics across environmental, social and governance, and it appears that this has been an effective determinant of business resilience in the pandemic. ',\n",
       "  'Therefore, the greater the visibility of this type of indicator across your supply chain, and the more sustainable your own practices in relation to managing supplier relationships, the greater protection you have for your own operations. ',\n",
       "  'As already mentioned, resolving immediate supply chain shocks has required ingenuity. For example, we have seen clients placing their own employees into supplier businesses to ensure continued production at their required levels. However, it has also involved the extension and embedding of responsible supply chain practices that have been evolving over recent years. ',\n",
       "  'If good ESG performance can increase the resilience of your suppliers, then procurement practices that promote the selection and management of suppliers based on these principles and engender collaborative relationships with these suppliers can only reduce the risk to your own organisation. ',\n",
       "  'We have seen first-hand a number of changes in how companies are managing their suppliers, and how the emphasis has shifted to more sustainable approaches. The biggest enabler of the key themes that follow, is digitisation. Without the ever-increasing shift towards digital and online methods of supplier management, the coverage and currency of data required to make informed decisions would not be possible. ',\n",
       "  'A key focus for organisations is to carry out some form of supply chain mapping. This helps to provide transparency across the supplier base, ensuring that organisations simply understand who their suppliers are and where their goods and services are coming from. The greater the visibility that can be achieved across the tiers of the supply chain the greater the potential there is to de-risk. ',\n",
       "  'The aim of this enhanced visibility across the supply chain is threefold. It is to identify any vulnerabilities or risks in the supply chain, to enable appropriate supplier diversification and to improve individual and overall supplier performance. ',\n",
       "  'Vulnerabilities could result from single sources of supply with no viable or geographical alternatives. This vulnerability may need to be addressed with that the supplier through changed contractual terms or through on the ground collaboration to enhance resilience. ',\n",
       "  'However, in other instances there is a clear opportunity to implement dual-supply, whereby multiple suppliers provide the same service, providing resilience in times of stress. This is the antithesis of the trend towards lean supply chains and maximising cost savings and time efficiencies. However, in the world of digitisation, it is becoming increasingly possible to strike a balance between resilience and efficiency. ',\n",
       "  'The other large shift in supplier management we have seen as a result of COVID-19 is in relation to both the way in which suppliers are assessed and the way in which they are continually engaged with. The breadth of assessment has evolved from perceived business-critical requirements such as insurance documentation and information security, to become more holistic. Labour practices, sustainability programmes, environmental targets and emissions are covered in both qualification assessments and ongoing management indicators for suppliers. ',\n",
       "  'In some instances, suppliers are being engaged specifically on the practices they have put in place to deal with COVID-19 impacts right now, for example how they ensure continued supply from their suppliers and protect their workers. Similarly, it is important to understand how their business has prepared for the future, for example with a reduced set of products and services or a more agile approach to demand. ',\n",
       "  'There is also a greater focus now on continued engagement with these suppliers, and in many ways, successful engagement is the essence of a successful responsible sourcing programme. Responsive and sustainable supplier relationships are increasingly based on a collaborative approach to tackling global challenges such as climate change and slavery. COVID-19 has, however, highlighted whether organisations have the correct processes in place for engaging with suppliers quickly in order to address external shocks. ',\n",
       "  'Some organisations have not got to grips with managing supplier risk throughout their relationships with suppliers and instead only provide a limited form of pre-qualification assessment which provides no insight into ongoing risk. Others are much more advanced and have risk management programmes that are dynamic and ensure consistent assessments and remedial activities take place. ',\n",
       "  'However, even this is now viewed as limited ineffectiveness in a post-COVID world, the dial should be moved from ‘preventing bad’, to ‘doing good’. It is only through this lens that collaboration and equal partnership is brought to the fore to drive change. ',\n",
       "  'It seems then that COVID-19 has brought about significant changes in relation to supply chains and how they are managed, more than we can begin to speak about here. Sustainability has come to the fore and suppliers and entire supply chains need to be more resilient than ever before. However, as is often the case with seismic events, it is not so much that dramatic change has taken place, but instead, what was good has served us well and what was bad has failed us. ',\n",
       "  'It is with this in mind that we have the opportunity to build back better. According to\\xa0McKinsey, 93% of executives plan to increase supply chain resilience. The digitalisation of supply chains will therefore further increase, with organisations who cannot be flexible and responsive left behind. We may also see more of an emphasis on security of supply rather than speed and lowest possible cost. Something that could well provide knock on benefits to the environment as consumer expectations are realigned. ',\n",
       "  'We will see the importance of sustainability as an indicator of resilience increase, and with supplier management processes being a key element of ‘good’ sustainability we will see more focus on procurement’s ability to deliver this. According to Gartner, 51% of supply chain professionals expect that the focus on circular economy strategies will increase over the next two years. So we can expect even more emphasis on collaborative and sustainable approaches to supplier relationships, which will facilitate organisations journeys to goals such as net-zero and zero-waste. ',\n",
       "  'Despite the increased equality in the buyer-supplier relationship, there will still be the need for many organisation’s to create more robust risk management procedures through continued assessment, evaluation, audit and improvement plans. ',\n",
       "  'In the short to medium term suppliers should expect to have to satisfy information requests from more of their customers. However, in the medium to longer term with increases in standardisation of sustainability reporting frameworks and increasingly homogenous risk databases and metrics, demonstrating resilience and good practices should become more streamlined. ',\n",
       "  'COVID-19 has been a global struggle. It has highlighted the need for stronger and more responsive relationships between suppliers and buyers. It has been highlighted that, with external shocks of this scale, a collaborative approach is the only way to find a resolution. There will be more external shocks in relation to resource depletion, economic downturns and climate change to name but a few.

       " \"3. Companies had their targets validated against the SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard for the first full year in 2022. The Net-Zero Standard, introduced in October 2021, represents SBTi's most ambitious decarbonisation level, necessitating both near and long-term science-based targets to achieve complete emissions reduction by 2050. Of the 130 organisations that established net-zero targets in 2022, 78 (60%) were categorised as companies, with the remaining 40% being SMEs.

       " 'In an era of heightened awareness surrounding environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility, businesses are under increasing pressure to accurately report their carbon emissions and sustainability efforts. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a vital platform for organisations to transparently share their environmental data, strategies, and commitments. However, successful CDP reporting requires a year-round strategic approach that goes beyond simply meeting July disclosure deadlines. ',\n",
       " 'This article delves into five crucial practices that sustainable businesses should adopt now to ensure effective CDP reporting while fostering long-term environmental stewardship. ',\n",
       " 'Many organisations only start their CDP reporting shortly prior to the deadline and treat the disclosure as a project, but CDP reporting is an integral component of a company’s sustainability strategy. Embedding CDP reporting as part of an ongoing program will ensure that you are checking in on post-CDP actions and laying the foundations for next year’s reporting. ',\n",
       " 'This approach not only bolsters the credibility of your reporting but also cultivates an internal “culture of sustainability” within the organisation. By consistently addressing environmental concerns throughout the year, companies can seamlessly integrate sustainability practices into their operations and prepare for subsequent reporting cycles with enhanced readiness and accuracy. ',\n",
       " \"As the importance of verified greenhouse gas (GHG) data continues to rise, third-party assurance of reported data becomes a key priority. Planning for assurance well in advance is critical. Aligning with third-party auditors' schedules and incorporating verification into the annual reporting cycle ensures a smoother process and minimises the risk of last-minute inconsistencies. \",\n",
       " 'This proactive approach boosts transparency, instils investor confidence, and reinforces your commitment to accurate reporting, meeting both regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. ',\n",
       " 'Establishing a clear approval and sign-off process at the outset of your sustainability program is crucial. Defining stakeholders responsible for providing approvals ensures they understand the time required to align with the CDP reporting deadline. Transparent communication regarding timelines and necessary inputs minimises delays and misunderstandings. ',\n",
       " 'By facilitating a well-structured approval process, organisations can streamline reporting procedures, allowing for more efficient data aggregation, and ensuring that the final submission accurately represents their sustainability endeavours. ',\n",
       " 'Understanding your data coverage, particularly concerning Scope 3 emissions, is paramount for comprehensive CDP reporting. Conducting an in-depth analysis post-CDP submission can reveal potential gaps in material categories where data might be lacking. Identifying these gaps ahead of time enables engagement with relevant departments to gather essential information. ',\n",
       " 'This approach ensures a complete representation of sustainability efforts, highlighting accomplishments in emissions reduction and resource conservation across all relevant areas. ',\n",
       " \"Making significant commitments, such as science-based targets and carbon transition plans, demands thorough planning and alignment. These commitments often need months of defining, stakeholder engagement, and internal approval processes. Identifying the support required, both internally and externally in advance, assists the clear definition and approval of commitments well before the CDP reporting deadline. This proactive strategy ensures that commitments reflect your organisation's sustainability strategy. \",\n",
       " \"By incorporating these five practices into their sustainability strategies, businesses can go beyond meeting the CDP reporting requirements. Proactive planning, ongoing momentum, data assurance, streamlined approval processes, and comprehensive data coverage all contribute to a holistic and accurate representation of an organization's commitment to sustainability. \",\n",

       " \"Incorporating ESG, sustainability, and CSR practices is essential for companies looking to make a positive impact on society and the environment while creating long-term value for stakeholders. Sustainability is a broader concept that focuses on a company's role in society and managing its environmental and social impacts. CSR is a more defined term, but as ESG reporting becomes more mandated globally, it is increasingly being less used by businesses. ESG provides a more structured approach to reporting, with specific metrics and actual impact on a company's financial report taking centre stage. However, it is the act of being sustainable that is driving organisations to implement change.

       " 'The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) has made a significant impact in the sustainable finance sphere since its introduction in 2021. This regulation, which officially came into effect on March 10, 2021, requires all financial market participants in the European Union (EU) to report Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures, with additional requirements for products that promote ESG characteristics or that have sustainable investment objectives. ',\n",
       " 'There is a lot of discussion about what SFDR means for financial firms and ESG reporting. Our team of industry experts has written the following article, addressing the key points and meaningful deadlines of the regulation that businesses should be aware of. ',\n",
       " 'SFDR is part of an extensive ESG-based set of regulations implemented by the EU. The principal aim of this legislation is to redirect capital flow towards sustainable finance. Another key objective of SFDR is to prevent ‘greenwashing’ and provide transparency on sustainability within the financial market to ensure that financial market participants (FMPs) are able to embed sustainability into decision-making. ',\n",
       " 'Transparency is a vital aspect of this legislation, as it focuses on how providers of financial products manage and reduce sustainability risks. There are specifications at both entity and product levels. Specifically, the SFDR establishes and implements transparency criteria for financial commodity characteristics, allowing them to be compared based on their sustainability level. ',\n",
       " 'The SFDR regulation applies to FMPs such as investment firms, pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies, banks, venture capital funds, credit institutions offering portfolio management, or financial advisors. FMPs with fewer than 500 employees are not captured under the SFDR (although under the ‘comply-or-explain’ principle they are obligated to explain why). ',\n",
       " 'FMPs in the EU are required to disclose information on both their sustainability practices (entity-level) and their financial products (product-level). If these FMPs’ financial products make sustainable investments, the manager is required to demonstrate how those investments abide by the regulation\\'s \"do no significant harm\" policy. ',\n",
       " 'FMPs need to also report on their Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs) at both an entity- and a product-level. There are 50 PAI sustainability indicators (some mandatory and some voluntary) covering a range of ESG issues including greenhouse gas emissions, human rights and waste management. The regulation guidance regarding the timing of the reporting requirements on these PAIs is complex, but the entity-level reporting framework for PAIs began as a \"comply or explain\" requirement, shifting to \"comply\" for large FMPs on June 30, 2021. ',\n",
       " 'When approaching the SFDR regulation, one of the initial steps is establishing which sections are\\xa0relevant to your company and products. Then we suggest the following steps: ',\n",
       " 'Get to know the sustainability efforts and position of your business.Perform a gap analysis and risk assessment based on current ESG data, activities, and regulations (this will help you discover weak points and vulnerabilities).Establish what steps the company needs to take to ensure full compliance with SFDR.Begin building an SFDR approach tailored to your business.Develop a long-term strategy for implementing the sustainability risk policy, due diligence policy, remuneration policy, and communication tactics.

       " 'The non-financial, ESG, sustainability and CSR reporting landscape is constantly evolving. As regulatory sustainability reporting frameworks and investor requests increase, we see more and more companies adding to their commitments and establishing long-term global sustainability reporting strategies. The ability to provide assurance for sustainability risk management and ensure that the company has access to reliable data to report to business stakeholders has become one of the main focal points. ',\n",
       " 'Yet, deciding on a sustainability reporting software solution to support the ongoing management of sustainability and ESG data is often considered a process far more daunting than it really is. In this article, we break down how finding the right sustainability reporting software can support your company’s reporting and help you achieve your sustainability goals. ',\n",
       " 'Most companies are looking for sustainability reporting software because they are too reliant on overworked error-prone spreadsheets. The right sustainability reporting software will be one that eliminates data risks and allows for accurate data collection, calculation and management. Plus, your software provider should regularly update emissions factors and methodologies so you don’t have to worry about whether or not you are using the right calculation method. ',\n",
       " 'Spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to sustainability reporting software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service platforms provide daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention. ',\n",
       " 'The monitoring of performance over time is essential to understand long-term risks and opportunities. With an increase in the setting of long-term goals and commitments, this is now more relevant than ever. To build and manage a long-term sustainability strategy, you need access to current and correct data for both now and in the future – not just a time-stamped data set. ',\n",
       " 'Using a central sustainability reporting software platform to collect and manage ESG data enables you and your stakeholders to assess performance data on an ongoing basis, rather than in one moment in time. By sending questionnaires directly to suppliers or stakeholders through a software solution, deadlines, flags and notifications can be set which means that users can be automatically alerted when it’s time to request updated information or address an expired document. ',\n",
       " 'The ability to access accurate and consistent sustainability and ESG data across an organisation to enable responsible business decisions is now more important than ever. Sustainability reporting software enables users to customise questionnaires and data collection to ensure they are collecting the right data. Once collected, the sustainability reporting software will enable them to aggregate consistent, comparable and accurate ESG performance data from across the organisation. It also enables users to run comparisons across locations, benchmark and view key information across various metrics and KPIs. ',\n",
       " 'Many companies are still using spreadsheets and emails and, as data gets more complex, these processes become cumbersome, time-consuming and prone to error. Manual processes are not only a security risk but are also prone to error and can be extremely heavy on time and resources. ',\n",
       " 'Through the use of sustainability reporting software, data collection, management and reporting can all be automated, on a large scale, which leaves users more time for analysis. Using software enables users to move their focus away from just data collection and to in-depth reporting, analysis and informed decision-making. ',\n",
       " 'Meeting the scope of internal and external reporting requirements, and reporting to different stakeholders, requires a wide range of analysis tools and reporting dashboards. The right sustainability reporting software will allow you to model, apportion and compare data in a way that is relevant to your company and its stakeholders. Additionally, it should provide the option to group data into unlimited customisable sets. ',\n",
       " 'As reporting requirements increase, so do the volume and scope of data that you need to manage. The sustainability reporting software you choose should be robust and flexible enough for your reporting both now, and in 5 years’ time, to enable you to achieve your long-term goals. ',\n",
       " 'When selecting software, think about whether the solution will evolve with your reporting requirements and adapt to your changing organisational structure in years to come. It is also important to consider how often the software is updated and whether the updates are charged at an additional cost. ',\n",

However, whereas for an employee it may be communicated at a granular office level as part of a behaviour change competition related to energy savings, for suppliers, information about their contribution to the overall impact is much more valuable. Clients and consumers may care more about the environmental (e.g. CO₂, resources or natural capital) impacts of the energy consumed and shareholders/investors might want to know whether a green electricity supplier or renewable energy certificate (REC) is associated and being reported to frameworks such as CDP.

Within GRI, you report on environmental impacts, including supplier environmental impacts and environmental assessments in the supply chain.  ',\n",

But there's also an environmental impact there that needs to be considered in terms of how your suppliers interact with nature, natural capital and ecosystem services to then provide their supplier services to you. \",\n",

There are a lot of instances where companies have been in the media because of their supply chain issues, particularly in areas such as textiles and clothing. You've got organisations that have been thrown into the media spotlight around this, which has put social pressure on them to get a better handle on where their supply chain impacts are. Better than a reactionary approach to negative incidents is a process of proactive engagement with suppliers. \",\n",

       " 'In a lot of instances, organisations will already be asking the right questions or have most of the right questions. But because so much time is spent on gathering the information using an offline process, time to focus on the analysis of supply chain impacts is compromised. The traditional time constraints that are associated with collecting supplier information mean that organisations will tend to focus on their top-tier suppliers - the top 10 or maybe the top 20 whom they have a good relationship with. ',\n",
       " \"But there needs to be a fundamental shift, so the process of gathering all of this information can expand to cover the whole supplier base. A key part of this success is having really good relationships and contacts with your suppliers. It's no good trying to send questionnaires to info@companyX because you're likely to be ignored. Nurturing contacts and engaging all suppliers means you can get down to those smaller suppliers that you might not have necessarily considered before and ensure that you are investigating potential risks in all parts of your supply chain. \",\n",

In particular, those smaller ones that you might be spending less money on, particularly SMEs, in some ways, are more likely to need help with these areas of risk. The larger players that you're spending a lot of money with, are often large buyers themselves and therefore more likely to have the internal processes in place to understand and mitigate the risk in their supply chain. \",\n",

For most, if not all, organisations it is essential to have a constant flow of information from their suppliers, to make sure that even legally compliant organisations are not acting in a way that introduces risk. For example, even if a supplier is legally compliant, their operations can still be affected by an increased risk of flooding (or similar). Organisations, therefore, need to understand who will hold the liability, if any disruptions occur as a result of environmental factors and have the necessary data to support this. ',\n",
       " 'External pressure on organisations ',\n",
       " 'News stories get shared faster than ever before, which can lead to an uncomfortable level of transparency for some organisations. On top of this, individual companies can be targeted by social campaigners. These are people looking to influence and change a company’s approach to its supplier management. For example, it might be that a supplier is fully compliant with local requirements, but this is a different or lower standard to one expected. As a result, the buying organisation comes under social pressure to change or reform its supplier relationship to meet the required level. ',\n",

       " \"Supply chains are dynamic. And increasingly, they're complex and global. This means suppliers can come from anywhere in the world and the risks associated with each supplier relationship can differ significantly. \",\n",
       " 'To manage the risks that companies face from their supply chain, they need to put a clear strategy in place to ensure they know how their suppliers are performing when it comes to aspects such as standards, conduct, compliance and ESG requirements. ',\n",
       " 'This article aims to help organisations plan a strategy and process for the collection, management, analysis and reporting of supplier data. ',\n",
       " 'It’s no secret that there is more data in the world than ever before. But have you ever wondered whether you are gathering the right compliance information from your suppliers? ',\n",
       " 'What compliance data do you need to collect from your suppliers? ',\n",
       " 'It doesn’t matter if you are starting to collect information about your suppliers or refining an existing process, it is important to establish the data you need to collect. With so much information available, you’ll need to decide which topics, questions and documentation are most valuable to you and your organisation. ',\n",
       " 'The specific information can vary, depending on your industry, relevant legislative requirements and your organisation’s sustainability strategy. But, by understanding the data you need, you can tailor your supplier questionnaires to get the right information. ',\n",
       " 'How are you going to manage your suppliers’ responses? ',\n",
       " 'After you have decided what data you need to collect from your suppliers, it’s time to decide how to manage it. ',\n",
       " 'The volume of data you have from your suppliers can quickly become unmanageable, without the right system in place. For example, if you are relying on spreadsheets, you can find yourself with thousands of responses, across multiple spreadsheets, and in incomparable formats. ',\n",
       " 'An additional problem that organisations can face, is having different questionnaire responses held by different parts of the business. This can result in a poor understanding of overall supplier compliance, therefore increasing the risk to the business ',\n",
       " 'Having a tool to manage your supplier data will help you overcome these challenges, and ensure that you’re getting answers from your data.  ',\n",
       " 'How are you going to engage with your suppliers? ',\n",
       " 'Suppliers are being asked for similar information, in different formats, from numerous customers. This burden that is being placed on suppliers can jeopardise the response rate to your requests for information and dramatically increase the time spent chasing suppliers. ',\n",
       " 'The more you can do to standardise the information gathered across your sector, the easier it will be to engage your suppliers. Secondly, by moving to an online solution you will simplify the process for suppliers and, with the right tool, make it more efficient and empower each supplier to proactively use their data. ',\n",
       " 'By making the process as simple as possible for your suppliers, you also make it more straightforward for you. ',\n",
       " 'Collecting the supplier data you need is the first step to managing a supplier relationship. In fact, for many organisations, supplier data is a key source of information to inform key strategic business decisions. But, while many organisations currently collect data from their suppliers, the processes that they have in place are not always robust. Many rely on offline, manual approaches, which are time-consuming and inefficient. Here’s why your business can benefit from a structured process. ',\n",
       " 'Engagement makes data collection easier and more manageable ',\n",
       " \"Gathering the data you need to make informed decisions can be a challenge, even when it's just within your own company. Expanding this out to your suppliers can make it even harder to get the data you need. \",\n",
       " 'Your suppliers may well be apprehensive about sharing their data with you. But having a clear and properly structured plan for engaging with your suppliers means that you can mitigate their worries, while also highlighting the benefits. Look for opportunities where you can use your data collection process to help your suppliers, as it will mean they are more likely to share their data with you.  ',\n",
       " 'It’s an opportunity for you to complete a detailed analysis of your suppliers ',\n",
       " 'Thinking of collecting data from your suppliers as just a tick box exercise means you are missing opportunities to complete in-depth analysis and gain a deeper understanding of what is going on with your suppliers. ',\n",
       " 'While a large part of engaging with your suppliers will involve collecting data, going beyond this means that you can monitor for compliance and understand any potential risks. This will make it easier for you to identify any potential problems with your suppliers and react to them before they become business-critical. ',\n",
       " 'It can help make life easier for your suppliers ',\n",
       " 'Imagine this situation, you’re a supplier and every single one of your customers requires its own set of data. Suddenly you have to respond to potentially hundreds of data requests. This means duplication of effort and a time-consuming, repetitive process. ',\n",
       " 'Instead, if they were using a central online repository of all information that buyers want, it would mean that suppliers can reduce the manual input needed to recreate this information. They can use this system to share information with multiple buyers. ',\n",
       " \"Many factors continue to keep supply chain sustainability at the forefront of debate and it's important that organisations not just monitor, but account for and manage risk. Here’s how you can begin to understand the risks in your supply chain. \",\n",
       " 'What are the risks in your supply chain that you need to understand? ',\n",
       " 'This means looking at a variety of the risks that suppliers can present, including environmental and social. Companies that are reporting to various CSR frameworks, have to consider environmental impacts and\\xa0supply chain\\xa0risks. As part of CDP, for example, you report on the climate change risks for your organisation. Within GRI, you report on environmental impacts, including supplier environmental impacts and environmental assessments in the supply chain.  ',\n",
       " \"Therefore, if your suppliers are working in countries where there are climate change risks around, say flooding, or if you're working with raw materials, and those raw materials are at threat of depletion, then that's a business risk to the organisation. But there's also an environmental impact there that needs to be considered in terms of how your suppliers interact with nature, natural capital and ecosystem services to then provide their supplier services to you. \",\n",
       " \"There is also social pressure to consider. There are a lot of instances where companies have been in the media because of their supply chain issues, particularly in areas such as textiles and clothing. You've got organisations that have been thrown into the media spotlight around this, which has put social pressure on them to get a better handle on where their supply chain impacts are. Better than a reactionary approach to negative incidents is a process of proactive engagement with suppliers. \",\n",
       " 'How can you ensure you get relevant information from all your suppliers? ',\n",
       " 'In a lot of instances, organisations will already be asking the right questions or have most of the right questions. But because so much time is spent on gathering the information using an offline process, time to focus on the analysis of supply chain impacts is compromised. The traditional time constraints that are associated with collecting supplier information mean that organisations will tend to focus on their top-tier suppliers - the top 10 or maybe the top 20 whom they have a good relationship with. ',\n",
       " \"But there needs to be a fundamental shift, so the process of gathering all of this information can expand to cover the whole supplier base. A key part of this success is having really good relationships and contacts with your suppliers. It's no good trying to send questionnaires to info@companyX because you're likely to be ignored. Nurturing contacts and engaging all suppliers means you can get down to those smaller suppliers that you might not have necessarily considered before and ensure that you are investigating potential risks in all parts of your supply chain. \",\n",
       " \"This isn’t necessarily the suppliers you're spending the most money with because sometimes the organisations you are spending less with can incur more operational risk involved when you’re dealing with them. In particular, those smaller ones that you might be spending less money on, particularly SMEs, in some ways, are more likely to need help with these areas of risk. The larger players that you're spending a lot of money with, are often large buyers themselves and therefore more likely to have the internal processes in place to understand and mitigate the risk in their supply chain. \",\n",
       " 'Managing supplier relationships is no longer just about driving long term derived value from your supply chain. Companies are increasingly facing challenges that require them to proactively innovate how they manage the key stakeholders in their supply chains. In some areas, by outlasting the competition, you can grow your business significantly. No matter how big or small, it’s becoming essential for businesses to keep informed and up to date with modern standards and legislation affecting supplier management operations. ',\n",
       " 'The influence of environmental factors on supplier relationships ',\n",
       " 'As a starting point, complying with legal requirements is a minimum. For most, if not all, organisations it is essential to have a constant flow of information from their suppliers, to make sure that even legally compliant organisations are not acting in a way that introduces risk. For example, even if a supplier is legally compliant, their operations can still be affected by an increased risk of flooding (or similar). Organisations, therefore, need to understand who will hold the liability, if any disruptions occur as a result of environmental factors and have the necessary data to support this. ',\n",
       " 'External pressure on organisations ',\n",
       " 'News stories get shared faster than ever before, which can lead to an uncomfortable level of transparency for some organisations. On top of this, individual companies can be targeted by social campaigners. These are people looking to influence and change a company’s approach to its supplier management. For example, it might be that a supplier is fully compliant with local requirements, but this is a different or lower standard to one expected. As a result, the buying organisation comes under social pressure to change or reform its supplier relationship to meet the required level. ',\n",
       " 'Pressure coming from investors  ',\n",
       " 'Alongside the risks of environmental and social factors, there is growing pressure from the investor community. Investors are increasingly interested in business sustainability performance and also the benefits that can come from investing in forward-thinking organisations. Not having the evidence to prove to investors that due diligence on suppliers is being conducted could mean potential investors are less willing to commit, without the assurances they increasingly require.

       " 'The Greenstone team attended several panel discussions that revolved around topics such as supply chain resilience, net zero, sustainability leadership, finance and ESG, and more.  ',\n",
       " 'In this article, the Greenstone team shares five key topics that were discussed at the event. ',\n",
       " 'During one of the keynote sessions, Dr. Sally Uren, Chief Executive at\\xa0Forum for the Future, spoke on the need for deep transformation in the world’s systems to ensure sustainability change can occur at the necessary speed and scale. As part of this transformation, Dr. Uren challenged sustainability professionals to shift their mindsets and focus on a new ambition for sustainability. ',\n",
       " 'Outlined below is the journey sustainability has taken over the years along with where it is challenged to go in order to produce just and regenerative outcomes. ',\n",
       " \"Version 1.0: minimising negative impacts and doing less harm.Version 2.0: becoming neutral and heading to zero whilst making sure you're not doing any harm.Version 3.0: where we've been for the past few years in sustainability, which is focusing on net positive to give back into the environment more than we take out. Version 4.0: the next generation of sustainability, which is deliberate in reconfiguring the systems we depend upon to enable them to thrive in the long term. This is the new ambition that is not just focused on doing less harm, but on creating socially just, regenerative systems that thrive. \",\n",
       " 'Another topic often discussed was the difference between ESG and sustainability. Traditionally, these terms are often used interchangeably, but there are important distinctions between the two. ',\n",
       " 'The following definitions come from an\\xa0MIT article\\xa0that was shared during the conference.  ',\n",
       " 'ESG: “... is focused on screening companies for investments, largely by understanding how a business is affected by environment and social issues (with an additional focus on whether a company has good governance in place to manage those risks and pressures).” ',\n",
       " 'Sustainability: “… is a much broader idea, focusing on a company’s role in society, how it creates value by managing its environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), and how its actions affect a long range of stakeholders.” ',\n",
       " 'With the distinct definitions of ESG and sustainability in mind, attendees were challenged to think about what is lost when they focus on ESG and not on broader sustainability. With ESG being mainly focused on disclosures for investment, organizations can run the risk of losing sight of the need for actual impact. ',\n",
       " 'Some considerations to make when balancing disclosure and impacts have been outlined in more detail below. ',\n",
       " 'Investors increasingly rely on ESG raters and rankers when making decisions, but the question was posed if we have gone too far with them. While these raters and rankers can be advantageous tools, there are also disadvantages and considerations to be made: ',\n",
       " 'Advantages: ',\n",
       " \"Sophistication - ESG raters and rankers typically use sophisticated methods to assess companies' sustainability performance, drawing on a wide range of data sources and research that can provide meaningful insights into risk and opportunities.Leadership buy-in/push - Companies may find that ESG raters and rankers can help build executive support for sustainability goals and initiatives in efforts to improve ratings and stakeholder perceptions. \",\n",
       " 'Disadvantages: ',\n",
       " \"‘Check the box’ exercise (reporting for reporting’s sake) -ESG disclosure has the risk of becoming a box-ticking exercise, rather than a meaningful effort to drive progress on sustainability.Resource allocation - Responding to ESG raters and rankers can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for companies, particularly for smaller organisations or those with limited sustainability teams. With resources spent on disclosure, there can be little left over for implementing processes that drive sustainability.Scores that doesn’t reflect actual progress - ESG scores may not always accurately reflect a company's actual sustainability performance, and there is a risk that companies may selectively disclose information to improve their scores. \",\n",
       " 'Materiality assessments help bridge the gap between disclosure and impact in that they help inform organizations on which topics have impact and also what is important to the company’s stakeholders and investors. When looking through a\\xa0double materiality\\xa0lens, financial importance can be identified as well. ',\n",
       " \"One potential drawback of relying too heavily on ESG raters and rankers is that it can sometimes detract from the importance of storytelling in sustainability reporting. While sustainability reporting is often focused on disclosing quantitative data and metrics, it is also important to tell the story of a company's sustainability journey, and to highlight the positive impact that it has on its stakeholders and the broader community. \",\n",
       " 'One key consideration in sustainability reporting is the tension between striving for perfection and focusing on progress. While it is important to ensure that data is accurate and complete, it is also important to remember that sustainability is a journey, and progress towards goals is ultimately what matters most. ',\n",
       " 'During the event, there was a discussion about the future of mandatory sustainability disclosures, including the\\xa0proposed rule by SEC. Currently, the\\xa0proposed rule\\xa0would require disclosure of climate-related risks, impacts, and governance processes as well as Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. Scope 3 emissions are proposed to be required if deemed material or if the company has set a GHG emissions reduction target that includes Scope 3. ',\n",
       " 'Additional insights from the discussion are shared below. ',\n",
       " 'Investors look at risk and reward – climate is a huge risk ',\n",
       " 'Extreme weather events and regulatory changes can impact the financial performance of companies. This is why investors want more information from companies to better evaluate these factors. Mandatory disclosure can provide investors with the necessary information in a standardized format to make informed investment decisions and address challenges related to climate change. ',\n",
       " 'Investments committed to Net Zero ',\n",
       " 'Over\\xa0$66 trillion in assets\\xa0are already covered by a net zero plan, indicating that many investors are working towards reducing their carbon footprint. Companies can disclose climate-related information to help investors evaluate their progress towards achieving net zero targets. This information can include emissions data and information on climate-related risks and opportunities. ',\n",
       " 'Need for comparable data in a comparable place ',\n",
       " 'Investors are calling for standardised disclosure that provides comparable data in a single location. Currently, investors are requesting different types of disclosures such as SASB, SBTi and TCFD, which can create confusion and make it difficult to compare data between companies. A standardised approach would make it easier for investors to evaluate companies and for companies themselves to provide the necessary information. ',\n",
       " 'Raters/rankers create a selective disclosure problem ',\n",
       " 'As mentioned previously, rating agencies and ranking systems can create a selective disclosure problem and reporting overload, particularly when companies are asked to report to multiple frameworks. The proposed mandatory disclosure rule by SEC has the potential to decrease the number of frameworks that companies need to report to. Instead, companies can direct investors and stakeholders to their SEC filings for the necessary information. ',\n",
       " 'Align reporting to the GHG Protocol and TCFD ',\n",
       " 'To prepare for the upcoming mandatory disclosure, companies should consider aligning their reporting with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)’s framework and with the\\xa0Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s\\xa0emissions accounting methodology as a proposed rule was modelled off them. ',\n",
       " 'Examine climate risks and opportunities ',\n",
       " \"Companies should also take a closer look at their climate risks and opportunities and build processes to address them. This includes setting up processes to measure and report on emissions, identifying areas of improvement, and implementing solutions to reduce the company's carbon footprint. \",\n",
       " 'Scope 3 emissions emerged as a key topic\\xa0of concern during moderated sessions and networking events. We find it encouraging that sustainability professionals are all facing the challenges of Scope 3 emissions calculation and disclosure together. The reality is that no company has perfected it yet, and this is a complex issue that will require ongoing collaboration and effort to address. ',\n",
       " 'While the GHG Protocol breaks Scope 3 down into 15 categories, the most common challenges around Scope 3 with GreenBiz attendees stemmed from purchased goods and services, including supply chain engagement, and emissions associated with sold products. The following sections share additional details on these topics of concern. ',\n",
       " 'Provide tools to help suppliers/share best practices ',\n",
       " 'It is key to establish a partnership with suppliers and provide them with the necessary tools and knowledge to help them improve their sustainability practices. Sharing best practices can also be beneficial for suppliers to learn from one another and enhance their sustainability efforts. ',\n",
       " 'Make it clear why you are asking for certain information ',\n",
       " \"To enhance supplier engagement, it's crucial to provide clarity on the purpose behind requesting specific information. Instead of simply sending out a questionnaire, companies should add some context to it, explaining why they need the information and how it will help them achieve their net-zero targets or improve their performance metrics. \",\n",
       " 'Include sustainability as a performance metric ',\n",
       " \"By including sustainability as a performance metric, suppliers are more likely to comply with disclosing information. This can be achieved by incorporating sustainability goals and disclosure requirements into their contract language. When suppliers are held accountable for meeting these goals and disclosing information, it can increase their motivation to comply with your company's sustainability reporting requirements. \",\n",
       " 'Screen to identify hot spots ',\n",
       " 'Speakers on the subject emphasised the importance of conducting a screening to identify \"hot spots\" when assessing suppliers. This allows companies to prioritise their efforts and avoid wasting time on areas that may not be material or suppliers that are less impactful. ',\n",
       " 'Collect primary data instead of using spend-based calculation ',\n",
       " 'It was highlighted that spend-based calculations for Scope 3 emissions present challenges and limitations. While it may be a good starting point, companies should aim to focus on primary data as they progress further in their sustainability reporting journey. Without primary data, the emissions of the supplier will be viewed as standard for that category, and any innovations or emissions reductions progress they have made will not be captured.  ',\n",
       " \"Many manufacturing companies and those that sell products in the market are placing a significant focus on life cycle analysis (LCA) and sold-product emissions. However, it's worth noting that many and organisations are still figuring out the optimal approach. Open-source LCA sites were mentioned as helpful, but if your organisation has the resources, conducting an LCA on your own products is more beneficial. Similar to the spend-based approach for suppliers, having primary data for your products is crucial, and you can then fill in any gaps as needed. \",\n",
       " \"As mentioned, sustainability professionals are still grappling with how best to calculate Scope 3 emissions. As such, it's important to get comfortable with restatements and prepare leadership for them. It's common and often expected for data to change as enhancements in data collection and calculation are made and companies should be sure to be as transparent as possible when there are any restatements in their disclosures. \",\n",

There are multiple factors that contribute to this, such as more global supply chains, perceived efficiencies through digitisation, and the changing way in which services are delivered. ',\n",
       " 'However, the focus on managing supply chains more responsibly, or sustainably, is something that is relevant to all current and future procurement and supplier management activities. Sustainability is a key part of the evolution of procurement, and therefore needs to be fully understood and implemented. ',\n",
       " 'An estimated 70% of international trade today involves global value chains (GVCs), as services, raw materials, parts, and components cross borders – often numerous times. Once incorporated into final products they are shipped to consumers all over the world. This makes it crucial that organisations respond to an increased level of supply chain legislation, related stakeholder expectations and resultant supply chain risk. Companies are now operating in a world where company responsibility extends beyond the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) challenges of its own operations, and into far-reaching global supply chains. ',\n",
       " 'As a result, companies are increasingly seeking to create more sustainable supply chains. This is achieved by improving ESG performance throughout the supply chain, and in turn seeking to reduce costs, increase labour productivity, improve current processes, innovate and differentiate, as well as having a positive impact upon society. All these factors tend to fall under the remit of different departments within a business, which has led to the evolution of the ‘sustainable procurement’ professional.  ',\n",
       " 'This shift in the necessity for a ‘sustainable procurement’ function represents one of the greatest opportunities for business. But how does this change impact businesses? And are businesses currently structured in an appropriate way to take advantage of the opportunities available? ',\n",
       " 'A key challenge in aligning sustainability and procurement functions and practices is that until recently organisations have not necessarily been structured in such a way that facilitates alignment. The most obvious example of this is the difficulty with which organisations assign responsibility for tackling their supply chain. Even if creating more responsible supplier practices is something that is viewed as important by senior stakeholders, the roles at individual and department level do not necessarily reflect this. ',\n",
       " 'The most natural area of a business to address supply chain risk and compliance is often seen as procurement, as this is where the relationships with suppliers naturally exist. However, traditionally the success of a procurement function is determined by value and service delivery, meaning anything that diverges from this can be misunderstood or treated with scepticism.

       " 'The increased scrutiny on supply chains represents operational, financial, regulatory and reputational risks to an organisation. Businesses tend to be risk driven, and when faced with such risks involve the relevant operational and knowledge bases within the company to address them. ',\n",
       " 'Addressing supply chain risk, and in turn creating more responsible supply chains, should be no different. An integrated approach is required to embed sustainability into the operations of the company. To achieve this the criteria upon which suppliers are assessed need to combine both sustainability and traditional metrics, such as price and quality. This more holistic approach should not just be applied to the supplier selection process, but also form an integral part of ongoing supplier assessment and performance review. ',\n",
       " 'How to successfully adopt a more integrated approach depends on the structure of the organisation. Creating a sustainable procurement function that sits between sustainability and procurement, providing a link between the subject matter experts, is just one way.

The report highlights that human-caused climate change is already having severe impacts on vulnerable people and ecosystems worldwide, as the Earth is warming faster than previously thought. However, there is still time to take effective action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. ',\n",
       " 'Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: ',\n",
       " \"The report highlights the urgent need for deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reduction as crucial to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is essential to take immediate and decisive action to reduce emissions across all sectors, including transportation, energy production, and agriculture. The findings of the report reinforce the need for global cooperation and decisive action to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change and protect our planet's future. The window of opportunity to take meaningful action is rapidly closing, and it is crucial that we act now to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come. \",\n",
       " 'The burning of fossil fuels, coupled with unsustainable energy and land use, has led to a global warming of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature has resulted in more frequent and intense extreme weather events, leading to increasingly dangerous impacts on both nature and people in every region of the world. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more severe droughts, and devastating wildfires, among other things. The urgent need to transition away from high polluting energy and fuel cannot be overstated, as the continued use of unsustainable practices will only exacerbate these problems. We must view the transition to decarbonised forms of energy not only as a positive but an urgent necessity. ',\n",
       " \"Climate justice is a critical issue, as those who have contributed the least to climate change are being impacted the most. Additionally, nearly half of the world's population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change, which only exacerbates the issue. The key to solving this problem lies in climate-resilient development, which involves incorporating measures to adapt to climate change while simultaneously working to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in ways that provide broader benefits. Climate-resilient development is crucial as it helps communities to better prepare for and withstand the effects of climate change while simultaneously working towards a more sustainable future. \",\n",
       " \"Political commitment, coordinated policies, international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship, and inclusive governance are all crucial for achieving effective and equitable climate action. To combat climate change, it is essential to implement policies that promote sustainable development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural ecosystems. International cooperation is vital to ensure that all countries work together towards a common goal. Additionally, ecosystem stewardship, including the conservation of approximately 30-50% of the Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans, is crucial for ensuring a healthy planet. This requires inclusive governance that ensures the participation of all stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples. By prioritising effective and equitable climate action, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for all. \",\n",
       " \"Lastly, here's some uplifting news: a multitude of solutions to our current challenges are readily accessible today and have the potential to positively impact various aspects of our lives. Not only do they address health, equity, justice, biodiversity, and economic concerns, but they also enhance our resilience and expedite the shift towards a sustainable, clean energy future. \",\n",

Until recently, most companies primarily focused on measuring emissions from their own operations and electricity consumption.

While regulatory disclosure was not a motivator, 60% of respondents believe that compliance scope 3 reporting will be required in the future. However, data access is a significant barrier to developing a robust baseline, with limited supplier data being a primary issue. In addition, companies face challenges such as limited time and resources, interpretation of GHG accounting standards, and low comparability of baselines between peers. 70% of organisations have re-baselined their emissions in the last five years, 50% of which have been due to methodological changes.

Companies experience difficulties with low confidence in their ability to deliver scope 3 decarbonisation due to perceived consequences of failure and the maturity of delivery roadmaps. Additionally, a lack of target-setting methods tailored to company circumstances is a barrier, including sector specificity and accounting for growth. Respondents also cited unclear or ambiguous SBTi requirements, weak or unknown business cases, and a lack of understanding amongst company decision-makers as challenges for target setting. ',\n",

Although I am based in the US, my team’s role is inherently global. ',\n",
       " 'I joined the company in 2019 (when we were Viacom and then ViacomCBS) and ESG was something we knew was important as we re-merged Viacom and CBS – and we were quite early in our strategy journey. So, for the past three years, my team and I have been building out an ESG strategy that is grounded in reliable data and what is material to our business. My day-to-day role is really about finding opportunities for efficiency, clarity, further environmental responsibility and what resources we need to take them forward. ',\n",
       " 'Our ESG strategy is critical to our success as a company. We work to foster a better world for our employees, audiences, partners, and communities as Paramount.

       " \"Before coming to Paramount, I consulted for companies at every stage of the ESG and sustainability journey. Many companies just starting out in reporting often believe they need to have perfect answers before they can make a CDP submission. But really, CDP reporting is a tool – and it’s important to start wherever you are and establish a baseline for disclosure and evaluation. Many companies are still developing their climate change strategies and reporting to CDP is an important catalyst to help drive a company’s ongoing journey forward. Focusing on the topics that are material to the company is a good place to start. By demonstrating that you're engaging with the process, even with room for improvement, you can help strengthen your company’s reputation in sustainability. Transparency is key. \",\n",
       " 'CDP also helps us figure out where to focus our reporting efforts.

It helps us stay focused on what is material and relevant for our company while also helping us ensure that we’re using our own internal resources appropriately – focusing on what matters most.

There is no doubt that it was a significant year for business and ESG and we anticipate that 2023 will be no different, with greater demand for transparency and accountability. Below we have highlighted five key ESG reporting trends to look out for in 2023. ',\n",
       " 'For businesses, mandatory regulation on ESG reporting is coming in thick and fast, both in the EU and in the United States. ',\n",
       " 'In the EU, the\\xa0Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\\xa0is the latest EU Regulation regarding ESG and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero. It is a step up from the current EU Regulation the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding the number of mandatory reporting companies from 11,600 to around 49,000. ',\n",
       " 'The US is poised for regulation too. The\\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure rule\\xa0will launch in 2023 if approved. In March 2022, the SEC released a new proposal for public companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results. It requires all filers to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions that occur onsite and are controlled by the company. ',\n",
       " 'As ESG performance becomes a greater focus in the boardroom, companies are having to consider how best to hold themselves accountable. One way to accomplish this is to tie leaders’ compensation to positive ESG outcomes. Companies are increasingly including ESG metrics of some type in their incentive compensation schemes for top executives. ',\n",
       " 'In some companies, ESG and sustainability responsibility lies with the full board. Others assign diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) and human capital management issues to the human resources committee and sustainability oversight to audit or governance committees. The exact assignments will vary with each company’s specific needs and culture, but it is becoming critical to assign accountability and ensure sufficient governance oversight within a board. ',\n",
       " 'Corporate board demographics are changing too. Companies are now looking to assemble boards for ‘tomorrow’, today. For example, recruiting ESG expertise on the board has become critical and hiring has a DE&amp;I lens now more than ever. ',\n",
       " 'At the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP) in 2022, there was an emerging theme of natural capital and the need to prioritise the preservation of biodiversity. The risks resulting from a loss of nature and changes to natural capital have the potential to disrupt society and the stability of the global economy. Whilst most research on financial risks related to natural capital has historically focused on climate change, there is a growing awareness of the risks associated with other aspects of natural capital, such as water stresses, resource scarcity and the loss of biodiversity. ',\n",
       " 'Biodiversity-related corporate reporting\\xa0is a fast-moving, developing area, and there is ongoing work to create harmonisation, particularly related to measurement and disclosure. Companies should not wait for globally agreed frameworks or perfect tools to be available to approach the topic of biodiversity and nature. Companies should begin to understand and manage biodiversity and nature-related risk and opportunities and to prepare to respond to the introduction of frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). ',\n",
       " 'With more regulation and investor pressure, there is no doubt that companies will need a process to produce high-quality, defensible ESG data that is more aligned with financial reporting requirements. ',\n",
       " 'For investors, a company’s ESG performance is only as good as its data quality. Bad quality data can result in inaccurate reporting, lack of transparency, and potential backlash from stakeholders if your efforts are deemed unreliable. Demanding data transparency is the way investors can ensure that the ESG information provided is accurate and not misleading. ',\n",
       " 'Advances in technology and software solutions to enable in-depth ESG data analysis are increasing the expectations for ESG data quality and transparency. Once good quality primary data is collected, software solutions enable ESG performance data to be aggregated, compared and benchmarked across various global metrics, KPIs and frameworks.  ',\n",
       " 'The reporting of Scope 3 emissions (GHG emissions that are not produced directly from the reporting company but from the activities of its value chain), will continue to rise, and will continue to be a challenging area for many. Communication, collaboration and shared-goals are key to achieving successful Scope 3 disclosure. However, even if you have a high level of buy-in both up and down the value chain, there are still complexities around the data itself and the methodologies used to calculate emissions. ',\n",
       " 'Leveraging Scope 3 resources to understand where your material impacts lie, where to start with data collection and how to focus on data quality and coverage over time, will ensure that a journey to reliable Scope 3 data is followed. ',\n",
       " 'In summary, what does this mean for businesses and ESG-focused investors? For both groups, requirements to collect, assess and report quality primary ESG data will continue to grow in 2023 and beyond so now is the time to ensure you have future-proof data management processes in place. As the ESG and sustainability reporting landscape grows in complexity and becomes increasingly mainstream, there is a real opportunity for business to improve transparency and demonstrate leadership. Those who don’t address ESG performance – whether it’s across their own operations, their supply chains or their investment portfolio - face getting left behind. ',\n",

       " 'Greenstone attended the recent Responsible Investment Forum in London. Co-hosted with PRI, the Responsible Investment Forum is the longest-running private equity (PE) event focused on bringing together fund managers, institutional investors, and expert advisors to discuss ESG issues across alternative asset classes. ',\n",
       " 'Below we identify four key themes during the event: ',\n",
       " 'ESG continues to be high on the agenda for PE markets. Many general partners (GPs) are increasingly subject to higher scrutiny and regulatory compliance in an ever-evolving landscape. There is now much more emphasis on creating value through ESG performance, and a step away from the notion of ‘not doing harm’. ',\n",
       " 'Although PE firms are uniquely placed to realise ESG opportunities as a key value creation driver, the journey can be challenging and complex. The multiplicity of ESG frameworks, and obtaining reliable data to track performance, remain a challenge. However, as the industry matures, tools are being developed and ‘preferred’ frameworks are being adopted to align expectations. ',\n",
       " 'GPs can protect and create long-term value by enhancing value levers and integrating ESG into their value creation plans. Measuring performance against targets and building the knowledge and technology to support and improve those KPIs are key to the success, and sustaining asset value. ',\n",
       " 'A growing number of firms are developing decarbonisation strategies and many have set net-zero commitments and science-based targets across their portfolio. For these firms, defining a decarbonisation strategy is the most important starting point. Such a strategy typically involves setting out the overarching ambition and articulating carbon reduction targets, which can be broken down into short- and long-term measures. It is critical to align these targets with the firm’s overall ESG and fund strategy, serving as a guide for limited partners (LPS) and the investment team. ',\n",
       " 'However, setting realistic and achievable targets requires accurate measurement of primary data. This requires a streamlined approach to data collection and analysis, as well as portfolio engagement and education. PE firms need to truly engage with their portfolio companies’ management teams and set a clear roadmap. With active engagement at portfolio level, LPs can ensure that these portfolio companies feel part of their investor’s decarbonisation journey and understand what is expected of them year-on-year. ',\n",
       " 'Accurate and reliable ESG data is crucial to ensuring firms achieve their targets and create value. This not only relates to decarbonisation and the need for accurate emissions data, but is also true for the entire ESG spectrum. Primary data, sourced directly from portfolio companies, is how reliable value creation can be achieved. Anything else: secondary, or tertiary publicly available data, won’t stand up to scrutiny when it comes to monitoring the progress of targets and performance over time. ',\n",
       " 'To report robust and relevant data, LPs need to consider implementing a data strategy that future-proofs their reporting objectives. Embedding a data strategy will enable organisations to define a clear path for data management, facilitate reporting resilience, engage stakeholders, embrace technology and balance short- and long-term reporting effectively. ',\n",
       " 'As with any data request, it is essential to communicate what is required clearly but also expand on the when, how and why. Portfolio companies will look to investors for guidance on what is required today, but they also need to understand the context of the broader journey. For many privately held companies, they may not have been required to report on environmental or carbon data previously and as such, an educational element to their engagement is important. ',\n",
       " 'A challenge within the PE industry is the concept of letting perfection get in the way of progress. Stakeholders need to understand that perfection isn’t achieved overnight. ',\n",
       " 'ESG data is a great starting point and it’s important to have a baseline in order to monitor progress but we’re already seeing signs of ‘greenhushing’ where companies choose to keep their efforts quiet for fear of being accused of greenwashing. While there is a place for blatant greenwashing being exposed, more needs to be done to encourage companies to do their best to improve. ',\n",
       " 'ESG and sustainability reporting is a journey and the key to success is measurement of progress and stakeholder buy-in. CEOs and Boards need to be genuinely committed to the goals and need to be educated and informed at every step of the way. ',\n",
       " 'ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process. Investors are looking for purpose-built ESG software platforms to collect, track and analyse data and material ESG KPIs from their portfolios on an ongoing basis. ',\n",
       " 'Greenstone has been providing sustainability and ESG software solutions for 15+ years. Through its award-winning InvestorPortal software solution, focused on the collection, management and analysis of ESG and carbon data across an investment portfolio, Greenstone is enabling global PE firms to measure the ESG and carbon impact of their portfolios.

       " 'Over the past weeks, Egypt hosted the 27th\\xa0UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP27). The event took place at a resort in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6th\\xa0to the 18th. It brought together over 30,000 policymakers, activists, and scientists with the goal of pushing global and national commitments toward a more sustainable future. ',\n",
       " 'The event was split into Thematic Days to provide more focus on an extremely broad topic and agenda. The days included Finance Day, Science Day, Youth &amp; Future Generations Day, Decarbonisation Day, Adaptation &amp; Agriculture Day, Gender Day, Water Day, Ace &amp; Civil Society Day, Energy Day, Biodiversity Day, and Solutions Day. The inclusion of a Youth &amp; Future Generations Day was a novel idea acknowledging that youth play the smallest role in developing climate action plans but will suffer the largest consequences if developed plans are inadequate. ',\n",
       " 'In this article, we will consolidate the most relevant events from the different days of COP27 for businesses to consider as 2022 ends and they prepare for a more climate-focused future in 2023 and beyond. The conversations at COP27 can help predict what areas of sustainability will be given the most attention in the coming year and therefore provide important guidance for companies to stay ahead of industry trends. Some important themes from COP27 with implications on business include loss and damage financing, the rejection of greenwashing, the need for a higher carbon price, the rise of offsets, and a focus on biodiversity. ',\n",
       " '  ',\n",
       " 'On Monday, November 7th, the first day of the conference, delegates added the issue of \"loss and damage\" to the official summit agenda. Delegates hoped to discuss climate reparations to developing nations given their high vulnerability to climate impacts but low contribution to historical greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of the conference, the first-ever global agreement calling for climate reparations was established. The specifics of how this fund will operate will be laid out at COP28 next year in the United Arab Emirates. When diving into the text in detail, activists note the inclusion of “low-emission” energy as part of the solution. Some may worry this provides a loophole for natural gas and nuclear energy to continue to grow. Nevertheless, the creation of this agreement is a landmark achievement and will result in significant climate-dedicated cash flows to vulnerable nations. ',\n",
       " 'The structure of how climate reparations will work will not be set until next year. Therefore, businesses have a year to prepare in anticipation of next year’s COP28 agreement. Businesses can capitalise on the subsequent sustainability opportunities in previously underfunded countries. This agreement could open novel markets for companies in infrastructure, manufacturing, capital goods, and more for expansion and business development. With large sums of cash flowing to previously underfunded regions, companies may find new opportunities in regions not previously anticipated. ',\n",
       " 'On Tuesday, November 8th, the UN released a report about greenwashing and its widespread impacts on successful climate action. The UN provides a list of recommendations to ensure developed net zero pledges do not fall for greenwashing pitfalls. An example of one recommendation is the need to establish short- and medium-term absolute emissions reduction targets in addition to ones focused on the long term. Without targets for varying timelines, it is easy to develop unachievable long-term goals. Incremental work ensures companies and local governments continue to push themselves and do not forget about their plans for too long. ',\n",
       " 'The release of this report is a reminder that successful climate action requires reliable data to develop reliable plans and set realistic targets. Unreliable data and unrealistic goals provide short-sighted benefits but are extremely detrimental in the long term as companies and local governments try to undo false promises. Only those with legitimate emissions reductions will get to benefit from the positive publicity as governments crack down on greenwashing. Greenwashing is unlikely to be fully quashed any time soon, but in light of COP27, we suggest reviewing your climate goals to ensure they are ambitious but achievable to prevent false promises down the line. ',\n",
       " 'We all know inflation is on the rise. However, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the price of carbon also needs to see a significant rise. The IMF says that the carbon price must go up to at least $75/ton by 2030 for global climate goals to succeed. Timely for the European Union, they already established a benchmark price at about 76 euros/tonne. However, the EU is unique in its resolve as the US state of California has carbon allowances selling for just under $30/tonne and many regions have yet to establish a price at all. ',\n",
       " 'A carbon price can be established in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Although different in their design and implementation, both follow a structure that forces the original polluter to pay. Businesses that do not reduce their carbon emissions will feel the financial consequences as more regions implement these systems. Getting ahead of regulation is a smart strategy to prevent headaches and unnecessary taxes in the future. We recommend beginning the greenhouse gas accounting journey to start reducing emissions in advance of expensive regulation. ',\n",
       " 'During Finance Day, John F. Kerry, the White House climate envoy, outlined the USA’s carbon trading scheme. The voluntary plan aims to expand the sale of carbon credits globally to help boost renewable energy implementation in developing countries. The “Energy Transition Accelerator” will allow companies to claim credits for decarbonisation projects outside national borders and within developing countries. ',\n",
       " 'While the plan faced some backlash, its implementation could open opportunities for US companies to focus on clean energy as a means to offset necessary emissions of operations. Broadening beyond the US’s scheme, this COP saw a rise in the legitimacy of offsets. Offsets were pushed aside in past years to focus on other strategies. However, people noted a significant increase in offset conversations throughout COP27. Offset and renewable energy projects can help offset a company’s internal emissions or be sold to other organisations falling short. ',\n",
       " 'Although the 27th\\xa0UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change wrapped up this past weekend, the UN’s involvement in sustainability-related conversations is not complete for the year. The UN is hosting COP15, the UN Biodiversity Conference, in Montreal this December. On Wednesday, November 16th, Biodiversity Day of COP27, 350 civil society leaders called on heads of state to prioritise the upcoming event. ',\n",
       " 'Nature and biodiversity are becoming key sustainability issues of attention. Companies and governments need to respond and report to relevant frameworks. We see companies increasingly beginning to report on standards and frameworks beyond climate. For example, in 2021 the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) announced a new initiative called the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The framework was tested this year and is scheduled to officially launch in 2023. TNFD mimics the structure of TCFD with the intention to help companies and local governments report on the risks associated with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. We see businesses work towards biodiversity reporting to stay on top of sustainability trends. ',\n",
       " '  ',\n",
       " 'The end of COP27 boasts many exciting successes as well as evident shortcomings. Regardless of your perspective of the size of its impact, COP27, like all of the COPs before it, will push companies and governments in specific areas they hadn’t previously intended. COP27 was another step in highlighting the crucial need for delivery on climate action. ',\n",
       " 'Based on speeches of political leaders and reports presented, a world of climate related-regulation is coming into clearer focus. Global enforcement is not coming anytime soon but specific nations and regions are setting ambitious goals for themselves. Businesses can prepare for regulation in their operating regions today by beginning their GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reporting journey if they haven’t already. However, before diving into reducing a business’s emissions, a company needs a solid grasp of how much they are emitting and where it is originating. ',\n",

Once collected, you are then faced with the daunting task of combining datasets from different business functions into something that can be interpreted, analysed and reported on. ',\n",
       " 'As data gets more complex, using spreadsheets becomes cumbersome and there is a point where spreadsheets simply cannot handle the volume of data you need to report as part of your sustainability and ESG strategy. ',\n",
       " 'Greenstone, through its award-winning sustainability and ESG software, enables its clients to move away from spreadsheet outputs and time-consuming data collection; to in-depth reporting and analysis and real decision-making. Based on our experience of helping our clients do this, below we have outlined five reasons why spreadsheets are not fit to manage your sustainability data. ',\n",
       " 'It is likely that you will be dealing with large volumes of sustainability and ESG data collected from a long list of sources across your organisation. Putting all this data into a single spreadsheet can be a problem as Excel struggles with large file sizes. Whilst you can enter large volumes of data into Excel, you will find yourself waiting for ages for it to perform even the simplest calculations and the files can be unstable and can easily crash. ',\n",
       " 'Another factor that will affect the performance of your spreadsheet is the number of formulas and conditional formatting you use. As the complexity of your sustainability and ESG reporting increases with larger and larger datasets, you will find your formula-rich spreadsheets performing very slowly and eventually crashing. ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'One of the most limiting factors when using spreadsheets to manage your sustainability and ESG data is the lack of multiple user access options. Excel was never built for multiple users and even with modern versions, it is completely impractical to have more than a limited number of users access a spreadsheet at once. Even with a small number of users accessing a single file at one time, there is an increased danger of data loss. ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Excel can produce a number of reports, graphs and charts but they are limited and can easily become detached from automatic updates without clear indication. Sustainability and ESG software can automatically produce reports for internal reporting purposes, as well as global ESG and sustainability reporting frameworks e.g. CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD, DJSI and ISO, at the click of a button. ',\n",
       " 'The same goes for dashboards; Excel doesn’t come with dashboards, whereas sustainability management software comes packed with a variety of intuitive and customisable dashboards that multiple stakeholders within an organisation, whether software users or not, can access and easily understand. ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Excel spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to other software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service provides daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention. ',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Purpose-built sustainability management software is designed to be used for managing sustainability and ESG data and therefore the functionality tends to be intuitive, built for purpose and easy to use. Examples of this include industry-specific calculations, such as parallel GHG calculations across location-based, residual-mix and market-based emissions reporting coming as standard functionality. In Excel, you’ll have to build all this functionality into your spreadsheet yourself, which can take quite a lot of work and a good degree of training to use. ',\n",

EY teams recommend first looking at organisation materiality, supplier risk assessments and organisational commitment, for example science-based target (SBT) activation, supplier diversity, human rights, etc., and then determining which goals the supply chain activates.Improve the visibility and traceability of your supply chain.Deploy technological capabilities to help improve Tier-n visibility and supplier engagement. Communicate often with stakeholders through broader data sharing and collaboration tools.Expand your ROI measurement to include intangible impacts and sustainability outcomes.Think about business-case drivers beyond cost savings, including revenue, market share, reduced risk and improved customer and employee loyalty.Move beyond a sourcing and procurement focus to capture benefits across the end-to-end supply chain.\\xa0Enterprises should take an end-to-end approach, including planning, sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics and distribution. Cross-functional collaboration with other functions such as finance, risk and more can broaden opportunities for business benefits.Leverage available tax incentives and grants.Review your sustainability initiatives for cost benefits and tax impact.
