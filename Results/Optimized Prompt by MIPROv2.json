          "stabilized following distur- bances in the credit derivatives market in April and May related to developments in the 148 ANNEX SUMMING UP BY THE CHAIRMAN 148 The following remarks by the Chairman were made at the conclusion of the Executive Boards discussion of the Global Financial Stability Report on August 29, 2005. U.S. auto sector, and the corporate credit mar- ket functioned surprisingly smoothly in absorbing downgrades in this sector. Directors observed that this likely reflected the relatively isolated nature of the difficulties as the corpo- rate sector remains broadly healthy, with strong balance sheets and low default rates. However, they considered that the corporate credit cycle appears to be peaking as corpora- tions have begun to increase balance sheet leverage in a variety of ways. This has increased the risk of specific corporate credit events causing corrections in credit derivative and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) markets in the period ahead. Directors noted",

A number of Directors, however, stressed the need to guard against the potentially destabilizing effect of hedge fund operations and of the growing use of structured products, while preserving the benefits of these innovations in terms of mar- ket efficiency and liquidity.

In the context of rising household indebtedness, mainly in the mortgage market, Directors welcomed the warnings that regula- tors in some major countries have given to their lending institutions to tighten credit standards. For the medium term, the risk of growing global imbalances has to be addressed by a cooperative effort by the major coun- tries, with each adopting policies appropriate to its circumstances.
